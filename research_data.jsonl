Yet this ability shares lnany features with conlmunication\nIn other animals, and has arisen fr01n these lnore prilniti(Je syste71IS\nXout 50 years ago the Linguistic\nSociety of Paris established a\nstanding rule barring from its\nsessions papers on the origin of language.\nThis action was a symptom of the times.\nSpeculation about the origin of language\nhad been common throughout the 19th\ncentury, but had reached no conclusive\nresults. The whole enterprise in conse\nquence had come to be frowned upon\nas futile or crackpot-in respectable\nlinguistic and philological circles. Yet\namidst the speculations there were two\nwell-reasoned empirical plans that de\nserve mention even though their results\nwere negative.\nA century ago there were still many\ncorners of the world that had not been\nvisited by European travelers. It was\nreasonable for the European scholar to\nsuspect that beyond the farthest fron\ntiers there might lurk half-men or man\napes who would be \"living fossils\"\nattesting to earlier stages of human\nevolution. The speech (or quasi-speech)\nof these men (or quasi-men) might\nthen similarly attest to earlier stages in\nthe evolution of language. The search\nwas vain. Nowhere in the world has\nthere been discovered a language that\ncan validly and meaningfully be called\n\"primitive.\" Edward Sapir wrote in\n1921: \"There is no more striking gen\neral fact about language than its uni\nversality. One may argue as to whether\na particular tribe engages in activities\nthat are worthy of the name of religion\nor of art, but we know of no people that\nis not possessed of a fully developed\nlanguage. The lowliest South African\nBushman speaks in the forms of a rich\nsymbolic system that is in essence per\nfectly comparable to the speech of the\ncultivated Frenchman.\"\nThe other empirical hope in the 19th\ncentury rested on the comparative meth-\nby Charlcs F. Hockett\nod of historical linguistics, the discovery\nof which was one of the triumphs of the\nperiod. Between two languages the re\nsemblances are sometimes so extensive\nand orderly that they cannot be attrib\nuted to chance or to parallel develop\nment. The alternative explanation is that\nthe two are divergent descendants of a\nsingle earlier language. English, Dutch,\nGerman and the Scandinavian languages\nare related in just this way. The com\nparative method makes it possible to ex\namine such a group of related languages\nand to construct, often in surprising de\ntail, a portrayal of the common ancestor,\nin this case the proto-Germanic lan\nguage. Direct documentary evidence of\nproto-Germanic does not exist, yet un\nderstanding of its workings exceeds that\nof many languages spoken today. .\nThere was at first some hope that the\ncomparative method might help deter\nmine the origin of language. This hope\nwas rational in a day when it was\nthought that language might be only a\nfew thousands or tens of thousands of\nyears old, and when it was repeatedly\nbeing demonstrated that languages that\nhad been thought to be unrelated were\nin fact related. By applying the com\nparative method to all the languages of\nthe world, some earliest reconstructable\nhorizon would be reached. This might\nnot date back so early as the origin of\nlanguage, but it might bear certain ear\nmarks of primitiveness, and thus it would\nenable investigators to extrapolate to\nward the origin. This hope also proved\nvain. The earliest reconstructable stage\nfor any language family shows all the\ncomplexities and ftexibilities of the lan\nguages of today.\nT hese points had become clear a half\ncentury ago, by the time of the Paris\nruling. Scholars cannot really approve of\nsuch a prohibition. But in this instance\nit had the useful result of channeling the\nenergies of investigators toward the\ngathering of more and better information\nabout languages as they are today. The\nsubsequent progress in understanding\nthe workings of language has been truly\nremarkable. Various related fields have\nalso made vast strides in the last half\ncentury: zoologists know more about the\nevolutionary process, anthropologists\nknow more about the nature of culture,\nand so on. In the light of these develop\nments there need be no apology for re\nopening the issue of the origins of hu\nman speech.\nAlthough the comparative method of\nlinguistics, as has been shown, throws no\nlight on the origin of language, the in\nvestigation may be furthered by a com\npat'ative method modeled on that of the\nzoologist. The frame of reference must\nbe such that all languages look alike\nwhen viewed through it, but such that\nwithin it human language as a whole can\nbe compared with the communicative\nsystems of other animals, especially the\nother hominoids, man's closest living\nrelatives, the gibbons and great apes.\nThe useful items for this sort of com\nparison cannot be things such as the\nword for \"sky\"; languages have such\nwords, but gibbon calls do not involve\nwords at all. Nor can they be even the\nsignal for \"danger,\" which gibbons do\nhave. Rather, they must be the basic\nfeatures of design that can be present\nor absent in any communicative system,\nwhether it be a communicative system\nof humans, of animals or of machines.\nWith this sort of comparative method\nit may be possible to reconstruct the\ncommunicative habits of the remote an\ncestors of the hominoid line, which may\nbe called the protohominoids. The task,\nthen, is to work out the sequence by\n89© 1960 SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN, INC\nThis content downloaded from\n\u0000\n\u0000\n\u0000\n\u0000\n\u0000\n\u0000\n\u0000\n\u0000\n\u0000\n\u0000\n\u0000\n\u0000\n\u0000\n74.111.45.22 on Sun, 28 Oct 2018 19:32:23 UTC\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/termsA set of 13 design-features is presented in the illustration on the op\nposite page. There is solid empirical jus\ntification for the belief that all the lan\nguages of the world share every one of\nthem. At first sight some appear so trivial\nthat no one looking just at language\nwould bother to note them. They become\nworthy of mention only when it is real\nized that certain animal systems-and\ncertain human systems other than lan\nguage-lack them.\nThe first design-feature-the \"vocal\nauditory channel\"-is perhaps the most\nobvious. There are systems of communi\ncation that use other channels; for exam\nple, gesture, the dancing of bees or the\ncourtship ritual of the stickleback. The\nvocal-auditory channel has the advan\ntage-at least for primates;-that it leaves\nmuch of the body free for other activities\nthat can be carried on at the same time.\nThe next two design-features-\"rapid\nfading\" and \"broadcast transmission and\ndirectional reception,\" stemming from\nthe physics of sound-are almost un\navoidable consequences of the first. A\nlinguistic signal can be heard by any\nauditory system within earshot, and the\nsource can normally be localized by bin\naural direction-finding. The rapid fad\ning of such a signal means that it does\nnot linger for reception at the hearer's\nconvenience. Animal tracks and spoors,\non the other hand, persist for a while; so\nof course do written records, a product\nof man's extremely recent cultural ev\nlution.\nThe significance of \"interchangeabil\nity\" and \"total feedback\" for language\nbecomes clear upon comparison with\nother systems. In general a speaker of a\nlanguage can reproduce any linguistic\nmessag� he can understand, whereas the\ncharacteristic courtship motipns of the\nmale and female stickleback are differ\nent, and neither can act out those ap\npropriate to the other. For that matter\nin the communication of a human moth\ner and infant neither is apt to transmit\nthe characteristic signals or to manifest\nthe typical responses of the other. Again,\nthe speaker of a language hears, by total\nfeedback, everything of linguistic rele\nvance in what he himself says. In con\ntrast, the male stickleback does not see\nthe colors of his own eye and belly that\nare crucial in stimulating the fe\nmale. Feedback is important, since it\nmakes possible the so-called internali\nzation of Communicative behavior that\n90\ntion,\" refers to the fact that the bodily\neffort and spreading sound waves of\nspeech serve no function except as sig\nnals. A dog, panting with his tongue\nhanging out, is performing a biologically\nessential activity, since this is how dogs\ncool themselves off and maintain the\nproper body temperature. The panting\ndog incidentally produces sound, and\nthereby may inform other dogs (or Im\nmans) as to where he is and how he\nfeels. But this transmission of informa\ntion is strictly a side effect. Nor does the\ndog's panting exhibit the design-feature\nof \"semanticity.\" It is not a signal mean\ning that the dog is hot; it is part of being\nhot. In language, however, a message\ntriggers the particular result it does be\ncause there are relatively fixed associa\ntions between elements in messages\n(e.g., words) and recurrent features or\nsituations of the world around us. For\nexample, the English word \"salt\" means\nsalt, not sugar or pepper. The calls of\ngibbons also possess semanticity. The\ngibbon has a danger call, for example,\nand it does not in principle matter that\nthe meaning of the call is a great deal\nbroader and more vague than, say, the\ncry of \"Fire!\"\nIn a semantic communicative system\nthe ties between meaningful message\nelements and their meanings can be ar\nbitrary or nonarbitrary. In language the\nties are arbitrary. The word \"salt\" is not\nsalty nor granular; \"dog\" is not \"canine\";\n\"whale\" is a small word for a large ob\nject; \"microorganism\" is the reverse. A\npicture, on the other hand, looks like\nwhat it is a picture of. A bee dances\nfaster if the source of nectar she is re\nporting is closer, and slower if it is far\nther away. The design-feature of \"arbi\ntrariness\" has the disadvantage of being\narbitrary, but the great advantage that\nthere is no limit to what can be com\nmunicated about.\nHuman vocal organs can produce a\nhuge variety of sound. But in any one\nlanguage only a relatively small set of\nranges of sound is used, and the differ\nences between these ranges are function\nally absolute. The English words \"pin\"\nand \"bin\" are different to the ear only at\none point. If a speaker produces a syl\nlable that deviates from the normal pro\nnunciation of \"pin\" in the direction of\nthat of \"bin,\" he is not producing still a\nthird word, but just saying \"pin\" (@r\nperhaps \"bin\") in a noisy way. The\nhearer compensates if he can, on the\nbasis of context, or else fails to under-\neffects by way of vocal gesture. There is\nan effectively continuous scale of de\ngrees to which one may raise his voice\nas in anger, or lower it to signal confi\ndentiality. Bee-dancing also is continu\nous rather than discrete. ,\nMan is apparently almost unique in\nbeing able to talk about things that are\nremote in space or time (or both) from\nwhere the talking goes on. This feature\n\"displacement\" -seems to be definitely\nlacking in the vocal signaling of man's\nclosest relatives, though it does occur in\nbee-dancing.\nOne of the most important design\nfeatures of language is \"productivity\";\nthat is, the capacity to say things that\nhave never been said or heard before\nand yet to be understood by other speak\ners of the language. If a gibbon makes\nany vocal sound at all, it is one or an\nother of a small finite repertory of fa\nmiliar calls. The gibbon call system can\nbe characterized as closed. Language is\nopen, or \"productive,\" in the sense that\none can coin new utterances by putting\ntogether pieces familiar from old utter\nances, assembling them by patterns of\narrangement also familiar in old utter\nances.\nHuman genes carry the capacity to\nacquire a language, and probably also\na strong drive toward such acquisition,\nbut the detailed conventions of any one\nlanguage are transmitted extragenetical\nly by learning and teaching. To what\nextent such \"traditional transmission\"\nplays a part in gibbon calls or for other\nmammalian systems of vocal Signals is\nnot known, though in some instances the\nuniformity of the sounds made by a spe\ncies, wherever the species is found over\nthe world, is so great that genetics must\nbe responsible.\nThe meaningful elements in any lan\nguage-\"words\" in everyday parlance,\n\"morphemes\" to the linguist-constitute\nan enormous stock. Yet they are repre\nsented by small arrangements of a rela\ntively very small stock of distinguishable\nsounds which are in themselves wholly\nmeaningless. This \"duality of pattern\ning\" is illustrated by the English words\nTHIRTEEN DESIGN·FEATURES of ani.\nmal communication, discussed in detail in\nthe text of this article, are symbolized on\nopposite page.

Few\nanimal communicative systems share this\ndesign-feature of language-none among\nthe other hominoids, and perhaps none\nat all.\nI t should be noted that some of these\n13 design-features are not independ\nent. In particular, a system cannot be\neither arbitrary or nonarbitrary unless it\nis semantic, and it cannot have duality\nof patterning unless it is semantic. It\nshould also be noted that the listing does\nnot attempt to include all the features\nthat might be discovered in the commu\nnicative behavior of this or that species,\nbut only those that are clearly important\nfor language.\nIt is probably safe to assume that nine\nof the 13 features were already present\nin the vocal-auditory communication of\nthe protohominoids-just the nine that\nare securely attested for the gibbons and\nhumans of today. That is, there were a\ndozen or so distinct calls, each the ap\npropriate vocal response (or vocal part\nof the whole response) to a recurrent\nand biologically important type of situ\nation: the discovery of food, the detec\ntion of a predator, sexual interest, need\nfor maternal care, and so on. The prob\nlem of the origin of human speech, then,\nis that of trying to determine how such a\nsystem could have developed the four\nadditional properties of displacement,\nproductivity and full-blown traditional\ntransmission. Of course the full story in\nvolves a great deal more than communi\ncative behavior alone. The development\nmust be visualized as occurring in the\ncontext of the evolution of the primate\nhorde into the primitive society of food\ngatherers and huntel s, an integral part,\nbut a part, of the total evolution of be\nhavior.\nIt is possible to imagine a closed sys\ntem developing some degree of produc\ntivity, even in the absence of the other\nthree features. Human speech exhibits a\nphenomenon that could have this effect,\nthe phenomenon of \"blending.\" Some\ntimes a speaker will hesitate between\ntwo words or phrases, both reasonably\nappropriate for the situation in which he\nis speaking, and actually say something\nthat is neither wholly one nor wholly the\nother, but a combination of parts of\neach.

Suppose an\nearly hominid, a man-ape say, caught\nsight of a predator without himself be\ning seen. Suppose that for whatever rea\nson-perhaps through fear-he sneaked\nsilently back toward others of his band\nand only a bit later gave forth the dan\nger call. This might give the whole band\na better chance to escape the predator,\nthus bestowing at least slight survival\nvalue on whatever factor was responsi\nble for the delay.\nSomething akin to communicative dis\nplacement is involved in lugging a stick\nor a stone around-it is like talking today\nabout what one should do tomorrow. Of\ncourse it is not to be supposed that the\nfirst tool-carrying was purposeful, any\nmore than that the Rrst displaced com\nmunication was a discussion of plans.\nCaught in a cul-de-sac by a predator,\nhowever, the early hominid might strike\nout in terror with his stick or stone and\nby chance disable or drive off his enemy.\nIn other words, the Rrst tool-carrying\nhad a consequence but not a purpose.\nBecause the outcome was fortunate, it\ntended to reinforce whatever factor,\ngenetic or traditional, prompted the be\nhavior and made the outcome possible.\nIn the end such events do lead to pur\nposive behavior.\nAlthough elements of displacement\nmight arise in this fashion, on the whole\nit seems likely that some degree of pro\nductivity preceded any great prolifera\ntion of communicative displacement as\nwell as any signiRcant capacity for tra\nditional transmission. A productive sys\ntem requires the young to catch on to\nthe ways in which whole signals are\nbuilt out of smaller meaningful elements,\nsome of which may never occur as whole\nsignals in isolation. The young can do\nthis only in the way that human children\nlearn their language: by learning some\nutterances as whole units, in due time\ntesting various blends based on that\nrepertory, and Rnally adjusting their pat\nterns of blending until the bulk of what\nthey say matches what adults would say\nand is therefore understood. Part of this\n!,earning process is bound to take place\naway from the precise situations for\nwhich the responses are baSically appro\npriate, and this means the promotion of\ndisplacement. Learning and teaching,\nmoreover, call on any capacity for tradi\ntional transmission that the band may\nhave.

A child can be taught how to avoid\ncertain dangers before he actually en\ncounters them.\nl' hese developments are also necessarily related to the appearance of\nlarge and convoluted brains, which are\nbetter storage units for the conventions\nof a complex communicative system and\nfor other traditionally transmitted skills\nand practices. Hence the adaptative\nvalue of the behavior serves to select\ngenetically for the change in structure.\nA lengthened period of childhood help\nlessness is also a longer period of plastic\nity for learning. There is therefore selec\ntion for prolonged childhood and, with\nit, later maturity and longer life. With\nmore for the young to learn, and with\nmale as well as female tasks to be taught,\nfathers become more domesticated. The\nincrease of displacement promotes reat the moment hunger for her.\nThere is excellent reason to believe\nthat duality of patterning was the last\nproperty to be developed, because one\ncan find little if any reason why a com\nmunicative system should have this\nproperty unless it is highly complicated.\nIf a vocal-auditory system comes to have\na larger and larger number of distinct\nmeaningful elements, those elements in\nevitably come to be more and more sim\nilar to one another in sound. There is a\npractical limit, for any species or any\nmachine, to the number of distinct stim\nuli that can be discriminated, especially\nwhen the discriminations typically have\nto be made in noisy conditions.

The telegraph operator has\nto learn to discriminate, in the first in\nstance, only two lengths of pulse and\nabout three lengths of pause. Each letter\nis' coded into a different arrangement of\nthese elementary meaningless units. Th�\narrangements are easily kept apart be\ncause the few meaningless units are\nplainly distinguishable.\nThe analogy explains why it was ad\nvantageous for the forerunner of lan\nguage, as it was becoming increasingly\ncomplex, to acquire duality of pattern\ning. However it occurred, this was a\nmajor breakthrough; without it language\ncould not possibly have achieved the\nefficiency and flexibility it has.\nOne of the basic principles of evolu\ntionary theory holds that the initial sur\nvival value of any innovation is con\nservative in that it makes possible the\nmaintenance of a largely traditional way\nof life in the face of changed circum\nstances. There was nothing in the make\nup of the protohominoids that destined\ntheir descendants to become human.\nSome of them, indeed, did not. They\nmade their way to ecological niches\nwhere food was plentiful and predators\nsufficiently avoidable, and where the de\nvelopment of primitive varieties of lan\nguage and culture would have bestowed\nno advantage. They survive still, with\nvarious sorts of specialization, as the\ngibbons and the great apes.\nMan's own remote ancestors, then,\nmust have come to live in circum\nstances where a slightly more flexible\nsystem of communication, the incipient\ncarrying and shaping of tools, and a\nslight increase in the capacity for tradi\ntional transmission made jqst the differ\nence between surviving-largely, be it\nnoted, by the good old protohominoid\nway of life-and dying out. There are\nvarious possibilities. If predators become\nmore numerous and dangerous, any\nnonce use of a tool as a weapon, any\nco-operative mode of escape or attack\nmight restore the balance. If food be\ncame scarcer, any technique for crack\ning harder nuts, for foraging over a\nwider territory, for sharing food so gath\nered or storing it when it was plentiful\nmight promote survival of the band.\nOnly after a very long period of such\nsmall adjustments to tiny changes of liv\ning conditions could the factors involved\n-incipient language, incipient tool-car\nrying and toolmaking, incipient culture\nhave started leading the way to a new\npattern of life, of the kind called human.© 1960 SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN, INC\nThis content downloaded from\n\u0000\n\u0000\n\u0000\n\u0000\n\u0000\n\u0000\n\u0000\n\u0000\n\u0000\n\u0000\n\u0000\n\u0000\n\u0000\n74.111.45.22 on Sun, 28 Oct 2018 19:32:23 UTC\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\u0000\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/termsA human talent\nThe June issue of this magazine contained an article full of learned speculation\non the neurological mechanism by which lines, straight and curved, are perceived.\nWhatever the mechanism, the nervous system is very good at seeing a line from\nexceedingly faint physical stimuli.

With\none, two, or three coats a range of\neffects can be produced from a flat\n\"natural\" surface to a rich, semi\nglossy, \"rubbed\" surface. The fast\nfilm formation permits application of\nsuccessive coats within minutes and\neliminates the problem of surface im\nperfections from dust in the air. Gentle\nrubbing as the film forms fills the ir\nregularities in the wood and smooths\nout the top of the lacquer. Though\nwater-based, the cream does not raise\ngrain. After drying, the film has good\nresistance to water. It adheres well to\nthe wood, seals it well, prevents pene\ntration of subsequently applied con\nventional finishes (if they are desired)\nbut holds them tenaciously.\nThe product itself is almost water\nwhite, with the color stability to sun-\n• light for which all cellulose acetate\nbutyrate coatings have been esteemed.\nIt neither darkens wood nor is itself\ndarkened with the passage of time.\nAll these interesting properties we have\ndemonstrated to our own satisfaction.

Enter\nesthetics. The human spirit must be\nnourished along with the human body.\nFor reasons apparently unrelated to\nbiological metabolism, the paste must\nbe dried in certain shapes, and the in\ntegrity of these shapes must be preserved\nright to the pearly portal of the alimen\ntary tract. This principle is ancient: the\nancient Romans ate spaghetti with\ncheese; the ancient Japanese ate maca\nroni pressed from a paste of cooked\nrice.\nWhen spaghetti or macaroni is\ncooked for too long or allowed to\nstand cooked, the human spirit is\noffended. The morsels of pasta revert\nto a sticky paste, millenia of cultural\nadvance undone because amylose has\ngone into solution and then has loosely\nhydrogen-bonded itself into a net of\nslime. But for this unfortunate tend\nency, the world's food supply would be\nless dependent on specialized durum\nwheats. Without them, the spaghetti\nand macaroni would get even stickier.\nThe problem now appears to be as\nsoluble as the amylose itself.\nFirst fruits of the victory can already\nbe tasted.
