Yet this ability shares lnany features with conlmunication\nIn other animals, and has arisen fr01n these lnore prilniti(Je syste71IS\nXout 50 years ago the Linguistic\nSociety of Paris established a\nstanding rule barring from its\nsessions papers on the origin of language.\nThis action was a symptom of the times.\nSpeculation about the origin of language\nhad been common throughout the 19th\ncentury, but had reached no conclusive\nresults. The whole enterprise in conse\nquence had come to be frowned upon\nas futile or crackpot-in respectable\nlinguistic and philological circles. Yet\namidst the speculations there were two\nwell-reasoned empirical plans that de\nserve mention even though their results\nwere negative.\nA century ago there were still many\ncorners of the world that had not been\nvisited by European travelers. It was\nreasonable for the European scholar to\nsuspect that beyond the farthest fron\ntiers there might lurk half-men or man\napes who would be \"living fossils\"\nattesting to earlier stages of human\nevolution. The speech (or quasi-speech)\nof these men (or quasi-men) might\nthen similarly attest to earlier stages in\nthe evolution of language. The search\nwas vain. Nowhere in the world has\nthere been discovered a language that\ncan validly and meaningfully be called\n\"primitive.\" Edward Sapir wrote in\n1921: \"There is no more striking gen\neral fact about language than its uni\nversality. One may argue as to whether\na particular tribe engages in activities\nthat are worthy of the name of religion\nor of art, but we know of no people that\nis not possessed of a fully developed\nlanguage. The lowliest South African\nBushman speaks in the forms of a rich\nsymbolic system that is in essence per\nfectly comparable to the speech of the\ncultivated Frenchman.\"\nThe other empirical hope in the 19th\ncentury rested on the comparative meth-\nby Charlcs F. Hockett\nod of historical linguistics, the discovery\nof which was one of the triumphs of the\nperiod. Between two languages the re\nsemblances are sometimes so extensive\nand orderly that they cannot be attrib\nuted to chance or to parallel develop\nment. The alternative explanation is that\nthe two are divergent descendants of a\nsingle earlier language. English, Dutch,\nGerman and the Scandinavian languages\nare related in just this way. The com\nparative method makes it possible to ex\namine such a group of related languages\nand to construct, often in surprising de\ntail, a portrayal of the common ancestor,\nin this case the proto-Germanic lan\nguage. Direct documentary evidence of\nproto-Germanic does not exist, yet un\nderstanding of its workings exceeds that\nof many languages spoken today. .\nThere was at first some hope that the\ncomparative method might help deter\nmine the origin of language. This hope\nwas rational in a day when it was\nthought that language might be only a\nfew thousands or tens of thousands of\nyears old, and when it was repeatedly\nbeing demonstrated that languages that\nhad been thought to be unrelated were\nin fact related. By applying the com\nparative method to all the languages of\nthe world, some earliest reconstructable\nhorizon would be reached. This might\nnot date back so early as the origin of\nlanguage, but it might bear certain ear\nmarks of primitiveness, and thus it would\nenable investigators to extrapolate to\nward the origin. This hope also proved\nvain. The earliest reconstructable stage\nfor any language family shows all the\ncomplexities and ftexibilities of the lan\nguages of today.\nT hese points had become clear a half\ncentury ago, by the time of the Paris\nruling. Scholars cannot really approve of\nsuch a prohibition. But in this instance\nit had the useful result of channeling the\nenergies of investigators toward the\ngathering of more and better information\nabout languages as they are today. The\nsubsequent progress in understanding\nthe workings of language has been truly\nremarkable. Various related fields have\nalso made vast strides in the last half\ncentury: zoologists know more about the\nevolutionary process, anthropologists\nknow more about the nature of culture,\nand so on. In the light of these develop\nments there need be no apology for re\nopening the issue of the origins of hu\nman speech.\nAlthough the comparative method of\nlinguistics, as has been shown, throws no\nlight on the origin of language, the in\nvestigation may be furthered by a com\npat'ative method modeled on that of the\nzoologist. The frame of reference must\nbe such that all languages look alike\nwhen viewed through it, but such that\nwithin it human language as a whole can\nbe compared with the communicative\nsystems of other animals, especially the\nother hominoids, man's closest living\nrelatives, the gibbons and great apes.\nThe useful items for this sort of com\nparison cannot be things such as the\nword for \"sky\"; languages have such\nwords, but gibbon calls do not involve\nwords at all. Nor can they be even the\nsignal for \"danger,\" which gibbons do\nhave. Rather, they must be the basic\nfeatures of design that can be present\nor absent in any communicative system,\nwhether it be a communicative system\nof humans, of animals or of machines.\nWith this sort of comparative method\nit may be possible to reconstruct the\ncommunicative habits of the remote an\ncestors of the hominoid line, which may\nbe called the protohominoids. The task,\nthen, is to work out the sequence by\n89© 1960 SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN, INC\nThis content downloaded from\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n74.111.45.22 on Sun, 28 Oct 2018 19:32:23 UTC��������������\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/termsA set of 13 design-features is presented in the illustration on the op\nposite page. There is solid empirical jus\ntification for the belief that all the lan\nguages of the world share every one of\nthem. At first sight some appear so trivial\nthat no one looking just at language\nwould bother to note them. They become\nworthy of mention only when it is real\nized that certain animal systems-and\ncertain human systems other than lan\nguage-lack them.\nThe first design-feature-the \"vocal\nauditory channel\"-is perhaps the most\nobvious. There are systems of communi\ncation that use other channels; for exam\nple, gesture, the dancing of bees or the\ncourtship ritual of the stickleback. The\nvocal-auditory channel has the advan\ntage-at least for primates;-that it leaves\nmuch of the body free for other activities\nthat can be carried on at the same time.\nThe next two design-features-\"rapid\nfading\" and \"broadcast transmission and\ndirectional reception,\" stemming from\nthe physics of sound-are almost un\navoidable consequences of the first. A\nlinguistic signal can be heard by any\nauditory system within earshot, and the\nsource can normally be localized by bin\naural direction-finding. The rapid fad\ning of such a signal means that it does\nnot linger for reception at the hearer's\nconvenience. Animal tracks and spoors,\non the other hand, persist for a while; so\nof course do written records, a product\nof man's extremely recent cultural ev\nlution.\nThe significance of \"interchangeabil\nity\" and \"total feedback\" for language\nbecomes clear upon comparison with\nother systems. In general a speaker of a\nlanguage can reproduce any linguistic\nmessag� he can understand, whereas the\ncharacteristic courtship motipns of the\nmale and female stickleback are differ\nent, and neither can act out those ap\npropriate to the other. For that matter\nin the communication of a human moth\ner and infant neither is apt to transmit\nthe characteristic signals or to manifest\nthe typical responses of the other. Again,\nthe speaker of a language hears, by total\nfeedback, everything of linguistic rele\nvance in what he himself says. In con\ntrast, the male stickleback does not see\nthe colors of his own eye and belly that\nare crucial in stimulating the fe\nmale. Feedback is important, since it\nmakes possible the so-called internali\nzation of Communicative behavior that\n90\ntion,\" refers to the fact that the bodily\neffort and spreading sound waves of\nspeech serve no function except as sig\nnals. A dog, panting with his tongue\nhanging out, is performing a biologically\nessential activity, since this is how dogs\ncool themselves off and maintain the\nproper body temperature. The panting\ndog incidentally produces sound, and\nthereby may inform other dogs (or Im\nmans) as to where he is and how he\nfeels. But this transmission of informa\ntion is strictly a side effect. Nor does the\ndog's panting exhibit the design-feature\nof \"semanticity.\" It is not a signal mean\ning that the dog is hot; it is part of being\nhot. In language, however, a message\ntriggers the particular result it does be\ncause there are relatively fixed associa\ntions between elements in messages\n(e.g., words) and recurrent features or\nsituations of the world around us. For\nexample, the English word \"salt\" means\nsalt, not sugar or pepper. The calls of\ngibbons also possess semanticity. The\ngibbon has a danger call, for example,\nand it does not in principle matter that\nthe meaning of the call is a great deal\nbroader and more vague than, say, the\ncry of \"Fire!\"\nIn a semantic communicative system\nthe ties between meaningful message\nelements and their meanings can be ar\nbitrary or nonarbitrary. In language the\nties are arbitrary. The word \"salt\" is not\nsalty nor granular; \"dog\" is not \"canine\";\n\"whale\" is a small word for a large ob\nject; \"microorganism\" is the reverse. A\npicture, on the other hand, looks like\nwhat it is a picture of. A bee dances\nfaster if the source of nectar she is re\nporting is closer, and slower if it is far\nther away. The design-feature of \"arbi\ntrariness\" has the disadvantage of being\narbitrary, but the great advantage that\nthere is no limit to what can be com\nmunicated about.\nHuman vocal organs can produce a\nhuge variety of sound. But in any one\nlanguage only a relatively small set of\nranges of sound is used, and the differ\nences between these ranges are function\nally absolute. The English words \"pin\"\nand \"bin\" are different to the ear only at\none point. If a speaker produces a syl\nlable that deviates from the normal pro\nnunciation of \"pin\" in the direction of\nthat of \"bin,\" he is not producing still a\nthird word, but just saying \"pin\" (@r\nperhaps \"bin\") in a noisy way. The\nhearer compensates if he can, on the\nbasis of context, or else fails to under-\neffects by way of vocal gesture. There is\nan effectively continuous scale of de\ngrees to which one may raise his voice\nas in anger, or lower it to signal confi\ndentiality. Bee-dancing also is continu\nous rather than discrete. ,\nMan is apparently almost unique in\nbeing able to talk about things that are\nremote in space or time (or both) from\nwhere the talking goes on. This feature\n\"displacement\" -seems to be definitely\nlacking in the vocal signaling of man's\nclosest relatives, though it does occur in\nbee-dancing.\nOne of the most important design\nfeatures of language is \"productivity\";\nthat is, the capacity to say things that\nhave never been said or heard before\nand yet to be understood by other speak\ners of the language. If a gibbon makes\nany vocal sound at all, it is one or an\nother of a small finite repertory of fa\nmiliar calls. The gibbon call system can\nbe characterized as closed. Language is\nopen, or \"productive,\" in the sense that\none can coin new utterances by putting\ntogether pieces familiar from old utter\nances, assembling them by patterns of\narrangement also familiar in old utter\nances.\nHuman genes carry the capacity to\nacquire a language, and probably also\na strong drive toward such acquisition,\nbut the detailed conventions of any one\nlanguage are transmitted extragenetical\nly by learning and teaching. To what\nextent such \"traditional transmission\"\nplays a part in gibbon calls or for other\nmammalian systems of vocal Signals is\nnot known, though in some instances the\nuniformity of the sounds made by a spe\ncies, wherever the species is found over\nthe world, is so great that genetics must\nbe responsible.\nThe meaningful elements in any lan\nguage-\"words\" in everyday parlance,\n\"morphemes\" to the linguist-constitute\nan enormous stock. Yet they are repre\nsented by small arrangements of a rela\ntively very small stock of distinguishable\nsounds which are in themselves wholly\nmeaningless. This \"duality of pattern\ning\" is illustrated by the English words\nTHIRTEEN DESIGN·FEATURES of ani.\nmal communication, discussed in detail in\nthe text of this article, are symbolized on\nopposite page.

Few\nanimal communicative systems share this\ndesign-feature of language-none among\nthe other hominoids, and perhaps none\nat all.\nI t should be noted that some of these\n13 design-features are not independ\nent. In particular, a system cannot be\neither arbitrary or nonarbitrary unless it\nis semantic, and it cannot have duality\nof patterning unless it is semantic. It\nshould also be noted that the listing does\nnot attempt to include all the features\nthat might be discovered in the commu\nnicative behavior of this or that species,\nbut only those that are clearly important\nfor language.\nIt is probably safe to assume that nine\nof the 13 features were already present\nin the vocal-auditory communication of\nthe protohominoids-just the nine that\nare securely attested for the gibbons and\nhumans of today. That is, there were a\ndozen or so distinct calls, each the ap\npropriate vocal response (or vocal part\nof the whole response) to a recurrent\nand biologically important type of situ\nation: the discovery of food, the detec\ntion of a predator, sexual interest, need\nfor maternal care, and so on. The prob\nlem of the origin of human speech, then,\nis that of trying to determine how such a\nsystem could have developed the four\nadditional properties of displacement,\nproductivity and full-blown traditional\ntransmission. Of course the full story in\nvolves a great deal more than communi\ncative behavior alone. The development\nmust be visualized as occurring in the\ncontext of the evolution of the primate\nhorde into the primitive society of food\ngatherers and huntel s, an integral part,\nbut a part, of the total evolution of be\nhavior.\nIt is possible to imagine a closed sys\ntem developing some degree of produc\ntivity, even in the absence of the other\nthree features.

Suppose an\nearly hominid, a man-ape say, caught\nsight of a predator without himself be\ning seen. Suppose that for whatever rea\nson-perhaps through fear-he sneaked\nsilently back toward others of his band\nand only a bit later gave forth the dan\nger call. This might give the whole band\na better chance to escape the predator,\nthus bestowing at least slight survival\nvalue on whatever factor was responsi\nble for the delay.\nSomething akin to communicative dis\nplacement is involved in lugging a stick\nor a stone around-it is like talking today\nabout what one should do tomorrow. Of\ncourse it is not to be supposed that the\nfirst tool-carrying was purposeful, any\nmore than that the Rrst displaced com\nmunication was a discussion of plans.\nCaught in a cul-de-sac by a predator,\nhowever, the early hominid might strike\nout in terror with his stick or stone and\nby chance disable or drive off his enemy.\nIn other words, the Rrst tool-carrying\nhad a consequence but not a purpose.\nBecause the outcome was fortunate, it\ntended to reinforce whatever factor,\ngenetic or traditional, prompted the be\nhavior and made the outcome possible.\nIn the end such events do lead to pur\nposive behavior.\nAlthough elements of displacement\nmight arise in this fashion, on the whole\nit seems likely that some degree of pro\nductivity preceded any great prolifera\ntion of communicative displacement as\nwell as any signiRcant capacity for tra\nditional transmission. A productive sys\ntem requires the young to catch on to\nthe ways in which whole signals are\nbuilt out of smaller meaningful elements,\nsome of which may never occur as whole\nsignals in isolation. The young can do\nthis only in the way that human children\nlearn their language: by learning some\nutterances as whole units, in due time\ntesting various blends based on that\nrepertory, and Rnally adjusting their pat\nterns of blending until the bulk of what\nthey say matches what adults would say\nand is therefore understood. Part of this\n!,earning process is bound to take place\naway from the precise situations for\nwhich the responses are baSically appro\npriate, and this means the promotion of\ndisplacement.

They\nmade their way to ecological niches\nwhere food was plentiful and predators\nsufficiently avoidable, and where the de\nvelopment of primitive varieties of lan\nguage and culture would have bestowed\nno advantage. They survive still, with\nvarious sorts of specialization, as the\ngibbons and the great apes.\nMan's own remote ancestors, then,\nmust have come to live in circum\nstances where a slightly more flexible\nsystem of communication, the incipient\ncarrying and shaping of tools, and a\nslight increase in the capacity for tradi\ntional transmission made jqst the differ\nence between surviving-largely, be it\nnoted, by the good old protohominoid\nway of life-and dying out. There are\nvarious possibilities. If predators become\nmore numerous and dangerous, any\nnonce use of a tool as a weapon, any\nco-operative mode of escape or attack\nmight restore the balance. If food be\ncame scarcer, any technique for crack\ning harder nuts, for foraging over a\nwider territory, for sharing food so gath\nered or storing it when it was plentiful\nmight promote survival of the band.\nOnly after a very long period of such\nsmall adjustments to tiny changes of liv\ning conditions could the factors involved\n-incipient language, incipient tool-car\nrying and toolmaking, incipient culture\nhave started leading the way to a new\npattern of life, of the kind called human.© 1960 SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN, INC\nThis content downloaded from\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n74.111.45.22 on Sun, 28 Oct 2018 19:32:23 UTC��������������\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/termsA human talent\nThe June issue of this magazine contained an article full of learned speculation\non the neurological mechanism by which lines, straight and curved, are perceived.\nWhatever the mechanism, the nervous system is very good at seeing a line from\nexceedingly faint physical stimuli.

INTRODUCTION\nThe complexity of vocal communication varies enormously across species, from humans with an endless\nrepertoire of sound combinations, to species of mongoose\nthat produce only three different sounds [1]. As we continue to document the diversity that exists in nature, we\nare increasingly able to use comparative studies to identify\nthe selective pressures responsible for increasing vocal\ncomplexity. One of the most salient findings that has\nemerged is that high levels of sociality are found in combination with a high degree of vocal complexity [2–5].\nFor example, ground-dwelling sciurid species with\nsocially complex groups (i.e. many age/sex classes) produce more acoustically distinct alarm calls than species\nwith fewer age/sex classes [2]. Although non-primate\ntaxa can be excellent study subjects for investigating the\nevolution of vocal complexity in general (e.g. rodents:\n[6]; bats [5]) primates, as our closest relatives, can provide insight into the evolution of the most complex\nvocal system—our own [7,8]. Moreover, primates exhibit\nextreme variation in social structure, making them\nparticularly well suited for uncovering evolutionary\nconnections between sociality and vocal complexity.\nFacets of primates’ sociality distinguish them from\nmost other mammals. First, primates exhibit an unusual\ndegree of sociality that some have proposed has resulted\nin a kind of ‘Machiavellian intelligence’ [9,10] in that\nindividuals are capable of forming coalitions [11],\ndeceiving others [12] and maintaining strong, longterm social bonds with both kin and non-kin [13–15].\nSecond, primates are unusual among mammals in that\nthe size of their groups is positively associated with\nsome aspects of brain size [10,13]. One intriguing explanation for this relationship is that primates require\nsophisticated cognitive abilities for keeping track of and\nmaintaining complex networks of social relationships\n[9,16,17]—particularly considering recent findings\nthat social networks actually enhance individuals’ fitness\n[18,19]. Offering further support, the strong positive\nrelationship between group size, time spent grooming\nand diversity of vocal repertoire in primates [20] suggest\nthat more vocalizations may indeed be necessary for\nnavigating the complex network of social relationships\nin primate societies.\n* Author for correspondence (gustison@umich.edu).\nOne contribution of 13 to a Theme Issue ‘The social network and\ncommunicative complexity in animals’.\nPhil.

Although a species’ repertoire size provides\none useful comparative metric, it is a composite\nmeasure with no information about the function of\nthe individual calls that comprise it. Here, we propose\nthat the function of vocal complexity can be understood by comparing vocalizations among closely\nrelated species with differing repertoire sizes to identify\nspecies-specific derived calls. In such cases, the function of greater vocal complexity matches the function\nof the derived calls. As an example of how this\napproach can provide insights about the evolution of\ncomplexity, we compare the vocalizations of geladas\n(Theropithecus gelada) and chacma baboons (Papio\nursinus)—two closely related Old World monkeys\nwith overlapping vocal repertoires but very different\necological and social structures.\n2. VOCAL REPERTOIRES OF PRIMATES\nAND OTHER MAMMALS\n(a) Repertoire size as a measure of complexity\nMammalian vocal communication is typically\ndescribed as being made up of discrete, functional\nunits, or ‘calls’ [21 – 23]. Based on these functional\nunits, vocal complexity is quantified in terms of (i)\nnumber of discrete vocalizations in the repertoire\n(repertoire size) [2,20,24,25], or less commonly, (ii)\ndegree of individuality within discrete calls [5,6,26].\nOther ways of assessing vocal complexity include quantifying syllable complexity, amount of information\ncontained within a call [5], or the number of calls\nwithin a specific category of vocalizations (e.g. alarm\ncalls [2]).\nSeveral mammalian species produce call variants, or\ngraded calls, which vary slightly in acoustic properties\n[27– 31], such as fundamental frequency [28], ‘pitch’\n[29] or duration [24] and, as a result, have different\nmeanings to receivers [29,32– 34]. For species with\nsmall, fixed vocal repertoires, these subtle alterations\nmay help to extend the flexibility of an otherwise limited repertoire [7]. However, identifying graded calls\nrequires detailed acoustic and behavioural analyses\nand data of comparable detail are rarely available for\nmultiple species. Therefore, as has become the convention in vocal studies [2,20,24,25], we refer to\nrepertoire size as the number of discrete calls that\nanimals in a population or species produce.\n(b) Vocalization types\nVocalizations are produced in many different contexts.\nSome are produced in response to external stimuli such\nas predators and food. We call these ‘allospecific’ vocalizations (table 1) and include alarm calls and food calls.\nAlarm calls can communicate the degree of risk\ninvolved [2,24], indicate predator type (i.e. aerial or\nterrestrial) [53,54], or combine information on risk\nand predator type [51]. Primates, in particular, are\nknown to produce alarm vocalizations specific to predator type, eliciting appropriate responses in receivers\n[55– 57]. Notably, the complexity of primate alarm\ncalls is generally attributed to a complex physical\n(rather than social) environment [58]. If different predators have different modes of hunting, primate prey\nshould have evolved different predator responses to\neach. By contrast, the complexity of alarm calls in a\nsmall social carnivore, the meerkat (Suricata suricatta),\nhas been attributed to the need for social coordination\n[4]. Relative to a sympatric-living herbivore species like\nCape ground squirrels (Xerus inauris), meerkats travel\nfarther from underground shelters in their open habitat\nto find living prey, and they depend on ‘sentinels’ to\nemit referential alarm calls that vary acoustically\nbased on predator type [4]. This strategy allows individual meerkats to decrease time spent being vigilant\nand increase foraging efficiency.\nThe other allospecific vocalizations, food calls, are\nless variable than alarm calls. Only a handful of studies\nhave demonstrated that variation in calls is related to\nthe quantity or quality of the food source [59]; but\nmost studies report a lack of variation [60]. Although\nalarm and food calls differ substantially in degree of\ncomplexity, they share two features: (i) they are elicited\nby non-conspecifics, and (ii) they are the only two contexts where proto-syntax (i.e. the combination of call\nelements to form new meanings) has been reported,\nspecifically in primates (food calls [61]; alarm calls [62]).\nThe vast majority of mammalian vocalizations are\nemitted during social interactions with conspecifics,\nunder conditions of varying motivational states (e.g.\nmating, aggression, fear). We call these ‘social’ vocalizations and divide them into two main classes—calls\nthat function over a long distance (‘loud calls’) and\ncalls produced in close-range social interactions\n(‘close-range calls’, table 1). Loud calls may function\nto attract or defend mating partners [63], defend a\nterritory or food source through maintenance of intergroup spacing [42,64], or re-establish contact with\ngroup members that are out of sight (‘separation\ncalls’) [38].\nClose-range calls are produced in agonistic, neutral\nor affiliative contexts. Calls produced in agonistic\ncontexts may function to assess or warn rivals, such as\ncontest calls that advertise fitness [42] or threat calls\nthat maintain a dominance hierarchy [46,65]. Harassed\nindividuals, on the other hand, may produce distress\ncalls, which probably function to appease the aggressor\nand attract coalition partners [50]. The specific function of some close-range calls made in strictly neutral\nor affiliative social situations has been more difficult\nto ascertain and little is known about them besides\nthe contexts in which they are produced [7]. Copulation calls, for example, do not appear to have the\nsame function across different species and may even\nserve no function in some instances [66,67]. Other\nclose-range calls are ascribed to an affiliative function,\noften described as ‘contact calls’ (e.g. in raccoons (Procyon lotor) [65]; capuchins (Cebus capucinus) [68]).\nContact calls can be produced in various ‘friendly’ contexts, such as during post-conflict reconciliation\ninteractions [69] and prior to friendly behaviours like\nallogrooming [50,70,71]. These close-range contact\ncalls are also produced in more ‘neutral’ behavioural\nstates like foraging and resting, and therefore could be\ninvolved in the maintenance of group cohesion and\ninter-individual spacing [72].\n1848 M. L. Gustison et al. Primate vocal complexity\nPhil. Trans. R. Soc. B (2012)Primate vocal repertoires are similar to those of\nother terrestrial mammals (table 1). Although primate\nrepertoires may be slightly larger (on average), there is\nconsiderable overlap between primates and other taxa,\nboth in total repertoire size and within each category of\ncalls. Species with large repertoires relative to other\nspecies in their order generally produce a large proportion of calls in just one or two categories of calls\n(e.g. long distance and competitive calls—Callicebus\nmoloch [38]; distress and contact calls—Pan troglodytes\n[46]; allospecific and contact calls—Suricata suricatta\n[51,52]). This suggests that specific needs related to\none domain (e.g. competition or affiliation) might\ndrive the development of large repertoires, rather\nthan an overall increase in repertoire across all categories. Within primates, no clear taxonomic pattern\nhas emerged with respect to repertoire size. Each\nfamily of primates (including great apes) contains\nspecies with large and small repertoires. Surprisingly,\ndespite the social complexity of primates, there is no\nconsistent trend for primates to have more social calls\nthan other mammals, which suggests that simple comparisons of numbers of calls are of limited utility.\n(c) Function of larger repertoires\nOne of the primary hypotheses put forward to explain\nlarge, complex vocal repertoires is that social complexity creates the need for more vocalizations [21,73– 76].\nComparative studies have found a positive relationship between social complexity and communicative\ncomplexity, providing support for this hypothesis\n[2,3,5,20]. In sciurids, the alarm call repertoire size\nincreases with the number of demographic ‘roles’\n[2]. Additionally, in primates, an increase in total\nvocal repertoire size was associated with both larger\ngroups and increases in time spent grooming—a\nmeasure of social cohesion [20]. These studies have\nbeen important for pinpointing aspects of sociality\nTable 1. Vocal repertoire size for exemplar species from Primata, Rodentia, and Carnivora broken down into six categories:\nAllospecific (alarm calls and food calls), long distance (separation calls, intergroup spacing calls), contact (short-range soft\ncalls), competitive (threat and display calls), distress calls (fear calls during agonism) and other (contexts unknown or made\nin several different contexts). Sources from Primata are drawn from the repertoire analysis made by McComb & Semple\n[20], excluding captive studies. Total repertoire sizes in this paper are slightly different because we did not count sequences\nof discrete call units as separate calls if the units were produced singly. Sounds that are not strictly ‘vocalizations’, such as\nsneezes, coughs and teeth chattering, are excluded from the table. For comparison, we focus on exemplar species from\nRodentia and Carnivora because of similarities in social and vocal behaviour.\nspecies name allospecific long distance contact competitive distress other total size citations\nOrder Primata\nAlouatta palliata — 1 — 8 2 1 12 [35]\nArctocebus calabarensis — 1 — 1 1 — 3 [36]\nCallicebus moloch 1 3 1 1 3 1 10 [37]\nCallimico goeldii 4 7 3 6 4 1 25 [38]\nCebus olivaceus — — 4 4 2 1 11 [39]\nCercocebus torquatus 4 1 3 5 1 — 14 [40]\nCercopithecus aethiops 5 — 3 5 3 3 19 [41]\nEuoticus elegantulus 2 1 2 — 1 — 6 [36]\nGalago alleni 1 — 2 1 1 — 5 [36]\nG. demidovii 1 1 3 1 1 1 8 [36]\nMacaca fascicularis 2 2 1 1 4 5 15 [42]\nM. radiata 1 1 3 7 4 3 19 [43]\nM. silenus 1 2 3 5 2 1 14 [43]\nMandrillus sphinx 1 3 1 — 4 — 9 [44]\nPan paniscus — — 4 — 1 4 9 [45]\nP. troglodytes 3 1 8 4 8 3 27 [46]\nPerodicticus potto — 1 2 1 1 5 [36]\nPongo pygmaeus 1 1 1 2 2 1 8 [47]\nPresbytis entellus 3 1 2 3 3 2 14 [43]\nP. johnii 2 1 3 4 3 1 14 [43]\nProcolobus badius 2 — — 5 2 2 11 [48]\nOrder Rodentia\nNotomys alexis — — 1 1 1 2 5 [23]\nN. cervinus — — — 1 1 2 4 [23]\nN. mitchellii — — 1 1 1 2 5 [23]\nN. fuscus — — 1 1 1 2 5 [23]\nOctodon degus 2 — 4 5 2 — 13 [49]\nOrder Carnivora\nLycaon pictus 3 2 7 5 2 6 25 [50]\nSuricata suricatta 11 — 7 2 2 3 25 [51,52]\nCynictis penicillata 3 — 2 2 — 1 8 [24]\nSpeothos venaticus — 1 3 2 1 — 7 [27]\nCerdocyon thous 2 1 2 1 — — 6 [27]\nChrysocyon brachyurus 1 2 2 2 1 — 8 [27]\nPrimate vocal complexity M.

VOCAL COMPLEXITY OF HUMANS AND\nOTHER PRIMATES\nRelative to humans, non-human primates (henceforth\nreferred to as ‘primates’) exhibit surprisingly simplistic\nvocal production [77,78]. (Note that a focus on vocal\nproduction ignores the more sophisticated language-like\nabilities that primates exhibit in terms of vocal perception [79]). According to the ‘source-filter-theory’ first\ndeveloped to describe human speech [80,81], vocal\nproduction entails two components: the ‘source’ of a\nvocalization (i.e. lungs and the vocal folds) and the\nmeans by which a vocalization is shaped, or ‘filtered’,\nin the vocal cavities (i.e. vocal tract). Speech relies\nheavily on the control of ‘formants’ or vocal resonances (a product of vocal tract morphology) to\nproduce distinct syllables and hence encode information [81]. Primates also produce formants but the\nformant structure (i.e. distance between sound frequency ‘peaks and valleys’ [81]) mainly encodes\nlimited information such as individual identity\n[82,83] and body size [84 – 86]. Even more elaborate\nare humans’ filtering tools, the descended larynx and\ntongue [81]. In most primates and other mammals,\nthe tongue remains flat inside the mouth. By\ncontrast, humans have remarkable control over the\nlocation and shape of the tongue [81,87], giving\nhumans unmatched plasticity in sound invention\n[88]. This unique vocal plasticity allows us to imitate\ncomplex sounds and invent novel sounds, a feat\nshared with some birds and cetaceans [89,90] but\nnot with other primates [77,78].\nDespite having a limited ability to imitate and create\nnew sounds, there are some features of primate vocal\nproduction that show similarities to human language.\nFor instance, some primates exhibit vocal dialects—\ngeographical variation in the acoustic structure of\ncertain vocalizations [91– 93]. Calls are recognizably\nhomologous between different populations of the\nsame species, but show acoustic distinctions related to\nvariation in habitat and the duration of isolation, similar\nto patterns in human linguistic diversity (e.g. [94]).\nAdditionally, primates such as chimpanzees (Pan\ntroglodytes) [95,96], blue monkeys (Cercopithecus mitis)\n[97] and capuchins (Cebus apella) [98,99] produce or\nsuppress vocalizations depending on the composition\nof the conspecific audience.\nPrimate communication also resembles the semantic\ncontent of human language. Several primates exhibit\npotentially ‘referential’ allospecific calls that are elicited\nby external stimuli (table 1). In some cases, the referential nature of these calls has been supported with\nplayback experiments. For example, each vervet\nmonkey (Chlorocebus pygerythrus) alarm call ‘refers’ to\na different type of predator (leopards, eagles and\nsnakes). Experimental playbacks in the wild indicate\nthat these different alarm calls produce different\npredator-appropriate responses in the absence of a\npredator [56]. In further support of the functionally\nreferential nature of primate vocalizations, habituation – dishabituation experiments on Diana monkeys\n(Cercopithecus aethiops) demonstrated that playbacks of\nleopard alarm calls or leopard growls resulted in predator-appropriate responses. These results suggest that\nDiana monkey responses are based on the underlying\nreferent (the predator) rather than any differences in\nthe calls’ acoustic properties [100].\nDespite some language-like properties of primate\ncommunication, humans exhibit unrivaled flexibility\nin mixing and matching different sounds to create\nnew meanings through syntax [77,78,101]. Very few\nmammalian species use combinations of calls, and\neven those that do are unlikely to use these combinations to generate new meanings. There are only a\nfew known cases where primates combine calls in\nways that change the meaning of the call elements\n(red-capped mangabeys (Cercocebus torquatus) [102];\nCampbell’s monkeys (Cercopithecus campbelli) [61];\nDiana monkeys (Cercopithecus diana) [57]). Importantly, these semantic combinations of sounds only\ncomprise a few specific elements and are highly constrained [102,103]. Non-human primate vocal\n‘productivity’ [104] is therefore far simpler than\nhuman communication and may, at best, be labelled\nas ‘proto-syntax’—a term that refers to rule-governed,\nrather than random, combinations of discrete sounds\nthat lack the sophistication of human grammar [61].\n4. FUNCTION OF DERIVED VOCALIZATIONS\nAlthough previous studies have been pivotal for identifying aspects of sociality that drive vocal complexity,\nwe still know relatively little about how large vocal\nrepertoires function in complex societies. One reason\nfor this is that comparisons of repertoire size alone\nfail to identify the specific calls that may have evolved\nin association with social complexity. With no knowledge about which calls are derived, we can say\nnothing about how those calls function. Another\nreason is that comparisons of group size alone fail to\nidentify the specific features about group life that\nrequire an increase in vocal complexity. Thus, several\nquestions remain unanswered: first, what specific\naspects of sociality create a need for vocal complexity?\nIs it the number of relationships, the nature of relationships or something else? Second, can we identify the\nderived components of the vocal repertoire that\nrelate to the demands of increased sociality? That is,\nif more social species have more calls, how are they\nusing these ‘extra’ calls?\nTo help answer these questions, we propose a systematic investigation of closely related species that\nmake detailed comparisons of the functions of ‘homologous’ (shared between species) and ‘derived’\n(unique to a species) vocalizations. Note that, although\na vocalization may be unique to a species because it was\npresent in the common ancestor and lost in the other\nspecies, we call them derived calls for simplicity,\nalthough the direction of the change (gain or loss)\nremains a hypothesis that can be examined by comparison to an outgroup. Previous studies have used\n1850 M. L. Gustison et al. Primate vocal complexity\nPhil. Trans. R. Soc. B (2012)comparisons among closely related species to understand vocal evolution [71] although not with the goal\nof understanding vocal complexity per se. In the\nprimate literature, several researchers have made comparisons of vocal behaviour between related species\n[36,43,105,106]. These studies often include general\nsimilarities and differences of call categories [36],\nacoustic structure [105] and/or contextual use [43]. In\none case [43], there was a clear attempt to identify\nhomologous and unique calls in two species of macaque\n(bonnet macaque (Macaca radiata) and lion-tailed\nmacaque (M. silenus)) and two species of langurs (Nilgiri\nlangur, Presbytis johnii ) and common langur (P. entellus));\nhowever, much of the ensuing analyses focused on the\ndifferential use of the homologous calls rather than\nexplaining the function of unique calls. The only study\nto date to focus on unique calls [44] compared the\nvocal behaviour of the forest-dwelling mandrill (Mandrillus sphinx) to published accounts of savannah-living\nbaboons (Papio spp.) and geladas (Theropithecus\ngelada). Kudo reported that mandrills produced two\nunique long-distance contact calls instead of the various\nshort-range calls made by baboons and geladas. Kudo\nproposed that this difference was likely due to ecological\npressures, as low-amplitude vocalizations do not travel\nwell in a forested environment where visual contact is\nalso limited [44].\nIdentifying homologous and derived vocalizations is\ncritical for identifying the specific social or ecological\nfactors that may account for complex vocal repertoires.\nHere, we use a comparison of the vocal complexity in\ngeladas with that in chacma baboons to demonstrate\nhow this homologous-derived vocalization strategy\nmay be implemented. By analysing calls from both\nspecies (all obtained from wild populations under\nnatural conditions), we control for variability in how\ncalls are classified which may drive some of the variation in overall repertoire size found in meta-analyses.\n5. GELADAS AND BABOONS—A CASE STUDY\nEarly researchers were struck by the intricate vocal behaviour of geladas as well as their unusually complex\nsocial groups [107 – 109]. Although some have proposed a causal connection between these factors\n[107], little progress has been made towards understanding why geladas, the only extant Theropithecus\nspecies, have elaborate vocal communication compared\nwith other primates. Thus, a comparison between the\nvocal behaviour of geladas and Papio baboons serves\ntwo purposes. First, these two taxa split relatively\nrecently (about 4 Myr ago), and Theropithecus and\nPapio are probably sister genera [110]. To human observers, they appear to produce similar calls in similar\ncontexts (e.g. affiliative grunts, threat grunts and\nalarm calls). It is therefore relatively straightforward\nto identify homologous calls, and simultaneously, to\npinpoint the unique call types that result in differences\nin vocal repertoire size. We can then assess how these\nunique calls are used to highlight the selective pressures\nthat may have favoured greater vocal complexity.\nSecond, the differences in the social system and\necology of geladas and baboons make the comparison\nparticularly useful for testing contrasting predictions\nabout the evolution of behavioural differences [111].\nBoth species live in matrilineal groups in which males\ndisperse [108,112,113]. Geladas aggregate into a\nmulti-level, fission – fusion society (forming groups as\nlarge as 1100 individuals) [114,115] and within this\ngroup they only recognize and primarily interact with\na small subset of the individuals within ‘harem-like’\nreproductive units of 2– 15 individuals [108,114 –\n117]. In these reproductive units, ‘leader’ males must\nmaintain social relationships with several females, and\nit is thought that maintaining close social bonds with\nhis unit females may serve to decrease the likelihood\nthat he will be out-competed by a non-unit, ‘bachelor’\nmale [118,119]. In contrast to their complex social\nsystem, gelada diets are simple and specialized, with\ngrass as the primary food item [120 –122].\nUnlike geladas, many baboons (e.g. chacma baboons\n(Papio ursinus)) have a single-level, multimale –\nmultifemale society with no discrete reproductive\nunits (20– 120 animals, [123 – 125]). Baboons maintain\ndifferentiated relationships based on kinship and dominance with all members of their group, but cross-sex\nrelationships consist mainly of temporary consortships\n[123 – 126]. In terms of ecology, baboons are extremely\ncomplex; they live in a range of habitat types and consume anything from fruits and seeds to insects and\nvertebrates [127 – 130].\nGiven that geladas and baboons differ in their sociality and ecology, we predict corresponding differences\nin the call types comprising their vocal repertoires. For\ninstance, geladas—specifically males—may produce\nmore types of calls that are used in affiliative situations.\nOn the other hand, baboons may use proportionally\nmore allospecific calls to communicate about general\nfeatures of the environment such as food items. To\ntest our predictions, we compared the vocal behaviour\nof geladas with one representative of the Papio genus—\nthe chacma baboon [44]—to identify derived call\ntypes. While we recognize that vocalizations from a\nsingle population may obscure variation within the\ngenus, both the literature and our experience with\nmultiple types of Papio baboons suggests that repertoire variation within Papio is minimal [44] and that\nthe types of vocalizations used by chacma baboons\nare very similar to even the socially-divergent Papio\nspecies, P. hamadryas [44,131]. Furthermore, our\ndescriptions of gelada vocalizations closely match\nthose from captive geladas [132] suggesting that such\nvocalizations are not unique to one population. For\nany derived vocalizations, we then conducted intraspecific analyses to determine their possible functions.\n(a) Study subjects\nData for this study come from 14 units within three\ndifferent bands in one community of wild geladas\n(about 1200 individuals) living in the Sankaber area\nof the Simien Mountains National Park, Ethiopia\n(2008 –2010) [113,114] and a single group of\nchacma baboons (group C) living in the Moremi\nGame Reserve in the Okavango Delta of Botswana\n(2001 –2002). The gelada units comprised one\nleader male, 0– 3 follower males, and 1– 11 females\nand their immature offspring. The gelada habitat\nPrimate vocal complexity M. L. Gustison et al. 1851\nPhil. Trans. R. Soc. B (2012)consisted of high-elevation open grassland and adjacent escarpments (sleeping sites). The chacma\nbaboon group ranged from 82 to 91 individuals,\nincluding 9 – 11 adult males, 29 – 31 adult females,\nand their immature offspring. The baboon habitat\nwas patchy scrub forest interspersed with seasonally\nflooded grasslands.\n(b) Comparison of gelada and chacma\nvocal repertoires\n(i) Data analysis\nWe opportunistically recorded vocalizations from 81\nadult geladas (males ¼ 36; Feb 2008–Apr 2010) and\n32 adult chacma baboons (males ¼ 11; Apr 2001–\nMay 2002) with a Sennheiser ME66 directional microphone connected to a digital stereo recorder (Marantz\nPMD 660 Digital Recorder for geladas; Sony VW-D6\nProfessional Walkman for chacma baboons). The call\ntypes and contexts of all vocalizations were described\nat the time of recording. Our analyses focus on\ncommon calls that occurred repeatedly during focal\nsampling and we do not attempt to describe all vocalizations produced in each species. The inter-observer\nreliability (between assignments made in the field and\nassignments that were blind to previous designations\nand based on isolated calls in the absence of contextual\ninformation) of a subset of these calls (five exemplars/\ncall type/species/sex class) was 96 per cent. We used\nAVISOFT (v. 5.1.12, R. Specht, Berlin) to generate\nspectrograms with a fast Fourier transformation size\nof 1024 points. Focusing on spectrograms with high\nsignal-to-noise ratio, we categorized call types by ear,\nvisual inspection of the spectrograms and the contexts\nin which they occurred (chacma females ¼ 50 calls;\nchacma males ¼ 32 calls; gelada females ¼ 72 calls;\ngelada males ¼ 92 calls). There were an equal\nnumber of calls per individual (within species/sex\nclass) for each call type (n ¼ 1 –3 call replicates per\nindividual, 6 –12 total calls per call type). We optimized\nthe frequency range of different call types (11 or\n22 kHz) where appropriate (time resolution of\n2.667–2.903 ms and a 100% frame).\nWe used Avisoft to quantify eight temporal and spectrum-based acoustic parameters in the spectrograms:\nduration, mean bandwidth, frequency under which\n25 per cent of the call’s energy lies (start, maximum\nand mean), number of harmonic peaks under 20 dB\n(maximum and mean), maximum peak frequency.\nThen, to determine the probability of correctly assigning each vocalization to a pre-categorized call type, we\nperformed stepwise discriminant function analyses\n(DFAs) with a subsequent leave-on-out cross-validation procedure for each of the four species/sex\nclasses separately [133]. We used multivariate analyses\nof variance (MANOVAs) to verify the significance of\nthe final DFA parameters. Finally, we identified homologous calls between species based on both acoustic\nand contextual similarity.\n(ii) Results\nMale and female geladas and chacma baboons produced a range of allospecific and social calls used in\nboth affiliative contexts (e.g. grooming and\ncopulation) and non-affiliative contexts (e.g. challenge\ndisplays and dominance interactions), with geladas\nproducing a greater number of call types (table 2).\nOf the 14 call types we identified, eight were found\nin both geladas and chacmas and six were unique to\ngeladas. The derived gelada calls occurred primarily\nin short-range affiliative contexts (table 2). Extant literature and our own observations indicated that most\nof the homologous call types are produced in a similar\nmorphological way—a vocalized exhale—while geladas\nproduce both inhaled and exhaled versions of calls that\nare acoustically distinct (we only separate inhaled and\nexhaled grunts here because they are the most\ncommon, but they also produce inhaled ‘moans’ and\n‘wobbles’, table 2).\nWe performed further analyses on 12 vocalization\ntypes, of which only seven were found in chacmas\n(figures 1 and 2). Other call types were excluded from\nfurther DFA analyses because they were rarely produced without overlapping vocalizations, and hence,\nthere were too few high-quality recordings to analyse\n(gelada female: display calls, moans, inhaled grunts,\nwobbles and yawns; gelada male: how barks, nasal\ninhaled grunts and alarm calls; chacma female: alarm\ncalls; chacma male: fear grunt, alarm calls and copulation calls). We were able to discriminate between\nall call types for each age-sex class, using DFAs;\nbased on eight acoustic parameters, we classified call\ntypes at a higher rate (range: 67.4 –93.8%; leave-oneout classification range: 50 –90.6%) than expected\nby random classification (range: 10 –33.3%). A\nMANOVA test carried out for each of the four\nspecies/sex classes showed that pre-categorized call\ntypes were significantly different from each other\nbased on variation in at least four of the chosen acoustic\nparameters (p , 0.003).\nIn sum, acoustic analysis shows that geladas share\na number of vocalization types with chacma baboons.\nWhile chacma baboons did not appear to have any\nunique calls, the analysis allowed identification of at\nleast five derived vocalization types in geladas:\ninhaled grunts, moans, pre-copulation calls, wobble\ncalls and yawns. We then carried out intraspecific\nanalysis to determine how these calls function in\ngelada society.\n(c) Intraspecific analysis of derived gelada\nvocalizations\n(i) Comparison of derived call use in gelada\nmales and females\nTo determine the function of the derived gelada vocalizations identified above, we first examined potential\nsex differences in the use of these calls. By definition,\npre-copulation calls were produced only by females\nin very straightforward contexts (i.e. produced prior\nto copulation). Thus, we focused here on the use of\ninhaled grunts, moans, wobbles and yawns. Behavioural data on adult male and female geladas were\nobtained between January 2009 and December 2010\nduring repeated 15-min focal follows of 53 females\n(mean + s.d.: 6.55 + 2.59 h per female; 348.50 h in\ntotal) and 13 leader males (6.60 + 1.86 h per male,\n85.75 h in total). During these focal follows we\n1852 M. L. Gustison et al. Primate vocal complexity\nPhil. Trans. R. Soc. B (2012)noted all vocalizations uttered by the focal animal, as\nwell as all social behaviour (e.g. approaches and\ngrooming interactions) involving the focal individual.\nNext, we determined sex differences in the use of\nderived vocalizations by carrying out a general linear\nmodel (GLM) with sex and average reproductive\nunit size (over the entire study period) as fixed factors.\nWe found that gelada males produced four of the\nderived calls (i.e. inhaled grunts, moans, wobbles\nand yawns) at a higher mean rate (14.13 calls per h)\nthan did gelada females (0.39 calls per h) (F1,63 ¼\n708.144, p , 0.001), and reproductive unit size did\nnot come out as a significant covariate (F1,63 ¼\n0.942, p ¼ 0.336). Thus, males appeared to be the\nsex using derived vocalizations. We next explored\nwhether these unique calls were used in contexts that\nare unique to males in gelada society.\n(ii) Functionality of derived gelada male calls\nFirst, we tested the hypothesis that derived social calls\nare used by males to maintain social relationships\nwith the unit females by examining vocal behaviour\nin the context of conflict resolution. Using all adult\nfemale focal data, we identified every fight (both as\nactor and receiver) in which the focal female was\ninvolved. These fights (n ¼ 107 events) were characterized by loud screams from the focal female (n ¼\n48 events), or direct, physical attacks from the focal\nfemale that included biting and slapping (n ¼ 59\nevents). We deliberately excluded any inconspicuous\nagonistic interactions (such as soft threat calls or\nvisual threats) that may have gone unnoticed by\nother group members. For each fight event we counted\nall derived vocalizations directed at the focal animal by\nmales in the 2 min preceding the event and the 2 min\nfollowing the event and compared these values with\nbinomial tests of proportions.\nSecond, we tested the hypothesis that derived social\ncalls were used by males in association with the presence\nof non-unit, ‘bachelor’ males that pose a threat to the\nleader males (all leader males are eventually ousted by\nbachelor males). We used all adult leader male focal\nTable 2.

In other\nwords, bachelor groups were either close to the focal\nmale (within 20 m: n ¼ 16 focals), far (more than 20 m;\nn ¼ 24 focals), or out of sight (n ¼ 26 focals). We carried\nout two GLMs with male identity as a random factor,\nbachelor distance as a fixed factor, and the rate of derived\ncalls as the dependent variable (first model: close versus\nfar; second model: close versus out of sight).\nWe found evidence that males used non-homologous\nderived calls to maintain cross-sex social relationships\nwith females in his units. Specifically, we found that\nmales directed derived non-homologous calls at\nfemales after fights happened (14 occurrences), and\nthey never used them before a fight (binomial test of\nproportions:\nx2\n1 ¼ 12:916, p , 0.001). On the other\nhand, we did not find any evidence that males used\nthe derived calls in response to the presence of bachelors. Leader males did not produce derived calls at a\nhigh rate when bachelor groups were close (3.23 calls\nper h) compared with when they were far away\n(2.04 calls per h) (F1,8 ¼ 0.394, p ¼ 0.548). Similarly,\nleader males did not produce derived calls at a higher\nrate when bachelor groups were close compared to\nwhen they were out of sight (2.51 calls per h) (F1,11 ¼\n0.078, p ¼ 0.785).\n(d) General discussion\nGeladas have an elaborate, almost ‘choral’ vocal repertoire [109] and live in a complex society with social\ngroups of varying sizes, making geladas an important\nmodel system for addressing hypotheses about\nvocal evolution. Identifying homologous vocalizations\nshared with Papio baboons allowed us to study the function of derived gelada vocalizations. It did not appear\nthat interacting with many individuals [20,141] was\nnecessarily an important factor in the use of derived\ncalls, as their production was not correlated with the\nsize of the reproductive unit. Rather, the need to maintain long-term bonds within the unit seemed most\nimportant; leader males used these derived vocalizations after fights broke out within their units. Thus,\nthe gelada-specific vocalizations may have evolved as\nan adaptation to simultaneously maintaining relationships both with and among multiple females—leader\nmales that are better able to ‘keep the peace’ of\ntheir reproductive units may, in turn, have higher\naffiliative\ngrunt\n100\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n1111\n11\n1 1 1 1\n1 111\n11\n100 100 100 100 100 100\n100\n100 100 100 100\n100 100100100100100\n100 100 100 100 100 100\ngelada\nmale\ngelada\nfemale\nchacma\nmale\nchacma\nfemale\nfrequency\n(kHz)\ntime (ms)\ncopulation\ncall\nthreat\ngrunt\nfear\ngrunt\nalarm\ncall scream\ndisplay\ncall\nFigure 1.

Primate vocal complexity\nPhil. Trans. R. Soc. B (2012)reproductive success [118]. It remains to be determined why the cross-sex bonds seen in geladas seem\nmore tightly linked to vocal complexity than the\nwithin-sex bonds found in both species.\nOur results suggest that future studies should examine whether hamadryas baboons (Papio anubis), a Papio\nspecies that also has a ‘harem-like’ structure [142],\nhave any evidence of greater elaboration of affiliative\ncall use by males. This comparison is particularly\nimportant for uncovering how vocalizations relate to\nspecific aspects of long-term bonds because hamadryas\nmales form long-term bonds with females but the\nrelationship is more coercive than in geladas and\nthere does not appear to be a need to ‘keep the\npeace’. In geladas, investigations of how females\nrespond to derived vocalizations and the subsequent\nbenefits to leader male fitness is an exciting direction\nfor future research. It may be the case, for instance,\nthat these derived vocalizations reduce female anxiety,\nsimilarly to the proposed anxiolytic effects of grooming\n[143 – 145].\nOne puzzling aspect of our findings is that the\nderived calls used by males are all used in similar contexts. Further work is needed to tease apart any\npotential differences between the derived gelada\ncalls but this redundancy suggests an additional\nhypothesis. Perhaps the extremely large groups of\ngeladas (herds can number up to 1000) and high\nrates of vocalizations (mean + s.d.: chacmas: 8.84 +\n4.49 calls per h, geladas: 16.95 + 8.51 calls per h)\ncreate ‘vocal clutter’ that the geladas have overcome\nby diversifying their most common call types—affiliative vocalizations. Thus the need to maintain bonds\nwithin a noisy backdrop of conspecific vocalizations\nmay favour greater vocal complexity, possibly explaining some of the group size effects seen in other\nstudies [20].\n6. CONCLUSIONS\nComparisons of repertoire size and components\nsuggest that primates are broadly similar to other\nmammals, despite primates having greater social complexity. However, our comparison of baboons and\ngeladas highlights the utility of making detailed comparisons among closely related species to understand\nvocal evolution. We were able to examine the function\nof recently evolved calls in detail and examine the\nspecific social implications of increased repertoires\nby focusing on specific call types, addressing sexual\ndifferences, and using behavioural measures to\ndescribe social complexity. We found that the larger\nvocal repertoire of geladas is linked to the maintenance of cross-sex bonds within the reproductive unit.\nBroadly focused theoretical and comparative analyses\n[2,3,5,20] are vital to drive the investigation of\ncommunicative complexity. We argue that there is\nalso a need for more focused analyses among carefully\nchosen taxa using directly comparable measures in the\nstudy of vocal complexity.\nWe are grateful to the Ethiopian Wildlife Conservation\nDepartment, the Amhara National Regional State Parks\nDevelopment and Protection Authority, and the wardens\nand staff of the Simien Mountains National Park for\ngranting us the permission to conduct this research in\nEthiopia.

Sweden\nAccepted 6 March 1995\nAbstract\nThis paper analyzes the function of certain aspects of cognition, like planning, deceiving, self-awareness, and\ncommunication. I distinguish between two kinds of representations of information. A cued representation stands\nfor something that is present in the current situation. Detached representations stand for objects or events that\nare neither present in the situation nor triggered by some recent situation. The inner environment of an animal is\ndefined as the collection of all detached representations. The fundamental difference between signals and\nsymbols is that the reference of a symbol is a detached representation, while a signal refers to a cued\nrepresentation. Detached representations make planning possible. I distinguish between immediate planning,\nwhere plans are made for present needs, and anticipatory planning, where future needs are predicted. The\nevolution of self-consciousness is outlined as a series of steps. The first is when other agents are seen as having\nan inner environment of their own. This is when deception becomes possible. A further step is when the agent\nrealizes that the other agents’ representations of the external world includes a representation of the inner\nenvironment of the agent itself. Then the agent can become self-conscious since it can form representations of\nits own representations.\nKeywords: Mental representation; Animal cognition; Planning; Deception; Symbols; Self-awareness\nL’homo tient debout.

The notion of a representation: Why a snake can’t think of a mouse\nWhen analyzing the cognitive functions of the ‘higher’ animal species, we often ascribe them a\nform of consciousness that includes functions like imagining, planning, deceiving, choosing, being\naware of other minds, and maybe even being self-conscious. Our naive understanding of such\ncognitive functions derives from our understanding of the corresponding human functions.\nIn this paper, I want to examine these features of cognition from an evolutionary perspective.\nRather than directly comparing, e.g., animal planning with human planning, I will ask, firstly, what\ncould be the evolutionary value of having a capability for planning, and, secondly, what other\ncognitive functions are required for such a capacity to evolve. My focus in this paper will be to\nanalyze the evolutionary jbzctions of certain aspects of cognition rather than to study their\nneurophysiological foundations or their behavioral correlates.\nI will argue that in order to understand the functions of most of the higher forms of cognition, one\nmust rely on an analysis of how animals represent various things, in particular the surrounding world\nand its possibilities. However, the very notion of a mental representation is one of the enigmas of\ncontemporary cognitive science.\nRoitblat (1982, p. 354) characterizes representations, at the most general level, as those things\n“that allow past experience to affect later behavior”. This definition seems to be too liberal since it\nincludes, as Roitblat himself recognizes, even the behaviorists’ approach. Whiten and Byrne’s\nproposal is equally liberal: “By ‘representation’ we mean simply a neurally coded counterpart of\nsome aspect of the world.“(Whiten and Byrne, 1988: p. 235).\nYet another definition is proposed by Vauclair (1990, p. 3 12): “Representation is an individual\nphenomenon by which an organism structures its knowledge with regards to its environment. This\nknowledge can take two basic forms: either reference to internal substitutes (e.g., indexes or images)\nor use of external substitutes (e.g., symbols, signals, or words)“. Again, I find the general\ncharacterization too encompassing. However, Vauclair presents Hackett’s notion of ‘displacement’\n(Hackett, 1960) and von Glasersfeld’s criticism of it in his discussion of animal communication (von\nGlasersfeld, 19771, which comes close to the proposal made here (see Section 7.\nI have no elaborated theory of representation to present, but a distinction that seems to capture an\nimportant aspect is that between transduced and inferred information (compare Fodor, 1986). Some\nkinds of animal behavior, like phototaxis, are determined directly by psychophysical mechanisms that\ntransduce information about the environment. In such cases no representations are involved. In other\ncases, the animal uses the incoming information as cues to ‘perceptual inferences’, which add\ninformation to what is obtained by the psychophysical transducers. That which adds information to\nsensory input I propose to call a representation ‘.\nIn order to illustrate the distinction between transduced and inferred information, let me present an\nexample borrowed from Sjijlander (1993, pp. 3-4) of how the different kinds of information will\naffect animal behavior. It seems that a snake does not have a central representation of a mouse but\n’ Fodor (1986, pp. IS- 16) argues that transduced information is equivalent to information about nomic properties. He\nprefers non-nomicness as a characterization of representations since “there is independent reason to suppose that nomicness\nis the more fundamental notion: unlike transduction nomicness is a concept that we need outside the information sciences”.\n(p. 16) I don’t accept this argument, since I, among other things, don’t share the scientific realism that underlies his notion of\nnomicness. Hence I stick to transducibility.P. G~rden~ors/Behavioural Processes 35 (1996) 263-273 265\nrelies solely on transduced information. The snake exploits three different sensory systems in relation\nto prey, such as a mouse. To strike the mouse, the snake uses its visual system (or thermal sensors).\nWhen struck, the mouse normally does not die immediately, but runs away for some distance. To\nlocate the mouse, once the prey has been struck, the snake uses its sense of smell. The search\nbehaviour is exclusively wired to this modality. Even if the mouse happens to die right in front of\nsnake’s eyes, it will still follow the smell trace of the mouse in order to find it. Finally, after the\nmouse has been located, the snake must find its head in order to swallow it. This could obviously be\ndone with the aid of smell or sight, but in snakes this process uses only tactile information. Thus the\nsnake uses three separate modalities to catch and eat a mouse. It has no central representation of a\nmouse since there is no communication between the three systems (except that one takes over when\nthe other finishes).\nCompare this with a cat chasing a mouse! The cat relies on a combination of information from\nseveral sensors: eyes, ears, nose, paws and maybe even whiskers. It can predict that the mouse will\nappear at the other side of a curtain when it disappears on one side. It can ‘infer’ information about\nthe mouse even if there is no immediate sensory information, for example when it is waiting outside a\nmouse-hole. In this sense the cat has a central representation of a mouse that is, at least to some\nextent, independent of the information transduced from any of the sensory modalities. In more\ntechnical terminology borrowed from Piaget, one can say that the cat has achieved object permanence. In contrast, the snake has no unified representation of a mouse (if it is appropriate to say that it\nhas a representation at all).\nOne conclusion to draw from this comparison between the cognitive powers of a snake and a cat is\nthat a central representation is tightly connected with cross-modality, i.e., that information received\nvia one modality is coordinated with information from other modalities. Davenport (1976) presents\nsome major results on cross-modal perception in apes and monkeys (see also Murray, 1990). He has\nthe following remarks on the evolutionary value of cross-modality: “First, it appears that multimodal\ninformation extraction of environmental information is likely to result in more veridical perception,\nand may facilitate cognitive functioning. Second, in my view, cross-modal perception requires the\nderivation of modality-free information, a ‘representation’. That an organism can have the same\nrepresentations, concepts or percepts, regardless of the method of peripheral reception, confers great\nadvantage on that animal in coping with the demands of living (Davenport, 1976, p. 147)“.\nCategorization is, in general, exploiting representations. When, for example, a bird not only sees a\nparticular object, but sees it as food, the bird’s brain is adding information about the perceived object\nthat, e.g., leads to the conclusion that the object can be swallowed. Since information is added,\nmistakes become possible, i.e., the inferences drawn from the representation may turn out to be wrong\n(“Pardon me”, said the the hedgehog and climbed off the scrubbing-brush). When 1 speak of\ninferences, I am in no way implying that they are made in an explicit form, symbolic or otherwise\n(see Gardenfors, 1994). Nor am I assuming that the animal is, in any sense, aware of the\nrepresentation, only that there is some generalizing factor that determines its behavior.\n2. Cued vs. detached representations: Why a chimp can make a tool\nMy primary aim in this article is not to demarcate representations from non-representations.\nHowever, I want to emphasize that there are different kinds of representations. The central thesis of266 P. Giirdenj~rs/Behuuiourcrl Processes 35 (1996) 263-273\nthis paper is that in order to give an accurate analysis of many phenomena in animal and human\ncognition, it is necessary to distinguish between two kinds of representations: cued and detached.\nA cued representation stands for something that is present in the current external situation of the\nrepresenting organism. A cat that hears a crunching sound in the closet and comes to believe that\nthere is a mouse there is using its perceptual stimuli as a cue for its mouse representation. In general,\nthe represented object need not be actually present in the situation, but the representation must have\nbeen triggered by something in a recent situation. Delayed responses, in the behaviorist’s sense, are\nbased on cued representations according to this characterization.\nIn contrast, detached representations may stand for objects or events that are neither present in the\ncurrent situation nor triggered by some recent situation. A detached representation thus requires no\nperceptual cue in order to be activated. A memory of something, that can be evoked independently of\nthe context where the memory was created, would be an example of a detached representation. For\nanother example, consider a chimpanzee, who performs the following sequence of actions: walks\naway from a termite hill, breaks a twig, peels its leaves off to make a stick, returns to the termite hill,\nand uses the stick to ‘fish’ for termites. This behavior seems impossible to explain unless it is\nassumed that the chimp has a detached representation of a stick and its use.\nI am not claiming that it is possible to draw a sharp line between cued and detached representations. There are degrees of detachment, and, as will be seen below, there are different types of\ndetachment. However, I still believe that the rough distinction between the two major kinds of\nrepresentations is instrumental in that it directs our attention to key features of the representational\nforms.\nA closely related distinction is proposed by Gopnik (1982, p. 378) who wants to “distinguish\nrepresentations in which there is some direct causal connection between the states from those in which\nthere is no direct causal connection”. In most cases this will give the same results as distinguishing\nbetween cued and detached representations. However, there are many kinds of causal links which are\nnot separated by Gopnik, for example the distinction between transduced and inferred information.\nFurthermore, I will try to show that it is fruitful to separate different kinds of ‘detachment’. I thus\nbelieve that my analysis is more fine-grained than what would have resulted from applying Gopnik’s\ndistinction.\nA caveat concerning my use of the notion of representation is that I view representations as\ntheoretical terms, in the way conceived of in philosophy of science (e.g., Sneed, 1971). Representations are theoretical idealizations, similar to ‘forces’ in Newtonian mechanics, that are introduced to\npredict and explain empirical generalizations (see Lachman and Lachman, 1982).\n3. The inner environment: Why lizards don’t dream\nWhat is the main advantage of detached representations in comparison to cued ones? In order to\nanswer this question, I will elaborate on an idea introduced by Craik (1943, p. 61): “If the organism\ncarries a ‘small-scale model’ of external reality and of its own possible actions within its head, it is\nable to try out various alternatives, conclude which are the best of them, react to future situations\nbefore they arise, utilize the knowledge of past events in dealing with the present and future, and in\nevery way to react in a much fuller, safer and more competent manner to the emergencies which face\nit”.P. Giirdenfors/ Brhmiourul Processes 35 (1996) 263-273 261\nUnder the heading of the inner environment, this kind of ‘small-scale model’ has been made\npopular by Dennett (1978): “the inner environment is simply any internal region that can affect and\nbe affected by features of potential behavioral control systems” (p. 79). Such an environment is\nnecessary for representing objects (like food and predators), places (where food or shelter can be\nfound), actions (and their consequences), etc., even when these things are not perceptually present.\nThe evolution of this kind of representational power will clearly increase the survival value of the\nanimal.\nAs a tentative definition, the inner environment of an animal will in this paper be identified with\nthe system of all detached representations of the animal and their interrelations. In particular, the\ndynamic features of the objects represented are included in the inner environment. Such features are\nessential for inferring consequences of possible actions. Again, I am not assuming that the animal is\naware of its inner environment, or of the processes utilizing this construct. This would amount to\nself-awareness, as will be discussed in Section 6.\nLike all theories of mind, the inner environment is a metaphor. Metaphors are neither true nor\nfalse, but they can be more or less productive as heuristics for developing more precise theories. In\nwhat follows, I want to show that the metaphor of the inner environment can help us explain the\nevolutionary value of several cognitive functions.\nIt seems that many species of animals have inner environments. For example, the searching\nbehavior of rats is best explained if it is assumed that they have some form of ‘spatial maps’ in their\nheads. Evidence for this, based on their ability to find optimal paths in mazes, was collected by\nTolman as early as the 1930s (see Tolman, 1948). However, his results were swept under the carpet\nfor many years since they were clear anomalies for the behaviorist paradigm. Vauclair (1987)\nprovides a more recent analysis of the notion of a ‘cognitive mapping’.\nIt is difficult to assess when the inner environment first appeared in the animal kingdom, but a wild\nguess is that it is coordinated with the development of the neocortex, i.e., roughly with the appearance\nof mammals. However, it is only with the development of cross-modal representations that we obtain\nadvanced forms of an inner environment (Davenport, 1976, Murray, 1990). Sjijlander (1993) notes\nthat mammals play, but reptiles don’t. There is also evidence of dreaming, which clearly presumes\nan inner environment, only among the mammals (see Fagen, 1981). Thus dogs can dream about\nhunting, but lizards cannot.\nAlso, birds seem to have cognitive capacities that presuppose something like an inner environment\n(interestingly enough, it is only mammals and birds who have a constant body temperature). For\nexample, their advanced spatial representations are well documented. It should be noted though, that\neven if several other taxa have spatial abilities, by being able to utilize landmarks etc., this does not\nentail that they have an inner environment. One operational test for the existence of a spatial inner\nenvironment is the ability to take shortcuts when previous hinders are removed.\nMy aim in the remainder of the paper is to establish that existence of an inner environment is a\nprerequisite for the evolution of many higher cognitive functions. The functions I will consider are\nplanning, deception, self-awareness, and linguistic communication.\n4. Planning: Why the squirrel does not make any provisions for the winter\nOne of the main evolutionary advantages of an inner environment is that it frees an animal who is\nseeking a solution to a problem from dangerous trial-and-error behavior. Jeannerod ( 1994, p. 2) says268 P. Giirdenfors/ Behavioural Processes 35 (1996) 263-273\nthat “actions are driven by an internally represented goal rather than directly by the external world”.\nBy exploiting its inner environment, the animal can simulate a number of different actions in order to\n‘see’ their consequences and evaluate them. After these simulations, it can choose the most\nappropriate action to perform in theeouterenviromuent. Of course, the success of the simulations\ndepends on how well the mner envtronment is matched to the perceptions of the outer. A monkey\nwho imagines a branch where there is none is soon a dead monkey - evolutionary selection pressures\nwill, in the long run, result in a sufficient correspondence between the two environments.\nThe ability to envision various actions and their consequences is a necessary requirement for an\nanimal to be capable of planning. Following Gulz (1991, p. 46), I will use the following criterion: An\nanimal is planning its actions if it has a representation of a goal and a start situation and it is capable\nof generating a representation of partially ordered set of actions for itself for getting from start to goal.\nThe representations of the goal and the actions must be detached, otherwise the animal has no choice.\nIn brief, planning presupposes an inner environment.\nThere are several clear cases of planning among primates and less clear cases in other species (see,\ne.g. Chapters 5, 7, 8 and 9 in Ellen and Thinus-Blanc, 1987, and pp. 58-61 in Gulz, 1991). The\ntermite-fishing chimpanzee mentioned earlier is one such example. By the way, this is an example of\nplanned tool-making.\nHowever, all evidence for planning in non-human animals concerns planning for present needs.\nApes and other animals plan because they are hungry or thirsty, tired or frightened. Oakley (1961 p.\n187) notes: “Sultan, the chimpanzee observed by Kohler, was capable of improvising tools in certain\nsituations. Tool-making occurred only in the presence of a visible reward, and never without it. In the\nchimpanzee the mental range seems to be limited to present situations, with little conception of past or\nfuture”.\nHumans seem to be the only animal that can plan for future needs. Gulz (1991, p. 55) calls\nplanning for present needs immediate planning while planning for the future is called anticipatory\nplanning. Humans can predict that they will be hungry tomorrow and save some food, and we realize\nthat the winter will be cold, so we start building a shelter already in the summer. The crucial\ndistinction is that for an animal to be capable of anticipatory planning it must have a detached\nrepresentation of its fiture needs. In contrast, immediate planning only requires a cued representation\nof the current need. There is nothing in the available evidence concerning animal planning,\nnotwithstanding all its methodological problems, that suggests that any species other than Homo\nsapiens has detached representations of their desires.\nBut, isn’t the squirrel who is gathering and storing food for the winter engaged in anticipatory\nplanning? No, it is not planning at all. It has no detached representation of the winter, let alone its\nneeds during the winter. The gathering behavior is routine behavior of an instinctual nature that\nappears stereotypically without sensitivity to varying circumstances. For example, if one fills the\nsquirrel’s stores, it still continues gathering until the ‘urge’ is gone.\n5. Deception: Why the partridge feigning a broken wing isn’t fooling the fox\nI want to analyze the evolution of self-consciousness as a series of comparatively small steps. A\ngood planner must consider the actions of other individuals (in particular if the planner belongs to a\nsocial species). A special case of representations in the inner environment concerns the minds of otherP. Girdenfors/ Behuvioural Procrsses 35 (I 996) 263-273 269\nindividuals. In my opinion, the first step in the evolution of self-consciousness is when other agents\nare not only seen as acting things, but as having an inner environment of their own, with beliefs,\ndesires, etc.\nIt is only when this representational capacity is accomplished that deception becomes possible.\nDeception, in the intentional sense, presumes a representation of other minds. To see this, let us turn\nto the worthwhile survey of tactical deception in primates by Whiten and Byrne (1988). After their\ninitial attempt to define ‘tactical deception’ was criticized in the commentary, they ended up with the\nfollowing definition (1988, p. 271): “Acts from the normal repertoire of the AGENT, deployed such\nthat another individual is likely to misinterpret what the acts signify, to the advantage of the\nAGENT’ ’ .\nThe key word in this definition is ‘deployed’. When this word refers to human behavior, it refers to\nan intentional act. I submit that the ordinary use of deception presupposes that the deceiver has some\nrepresentation of how the individual to be deceived will interpret the deceiving act. In other words,\ndeception presupposes that the inner environment of the deceiver contains some form of representution of the inner environment of the target individual. Note that deception presumes all the cognitive\nfunctions of (immediate) planning, and some more, i.e., an inner environment containing a model of\nthe inner environment of other individuals. Thus, this analysis predicts that deception will occur later\nthan planning in the evolution of cognitive functions. This thesis is most naturally interpreted as a\nstatement about phylogeny, but can also be given an ontogenetical meaning.\nWhiten and Byrne (1988) present a series of examples of potential cases of deception among\nprimates. Most examples come from field observations of chimpanzees and baboons *. However,\nalmost all evidence is based on more or less anecdotal material. Lacking controlled experiments, it is\ntherefore strongly debatable whether the evidence can establish that deception in the intentional sense\noccurs among animals other than humans (see Bennett, 1988).\nHowever, there are cases when it is clear that deception is not taking place: The partridge feigning\na broken wing to lure away the fox from her chicks is not fooling the fox. ‘Fooling’ presumes an\nintention to make somebody else misinterpret the fooling act. There is no evidence that the partridge\nhas any representation of what the fox thinks. She merely acts instinctively when the fox approaches\nand can hence not have any intention to fool.\n6. Self-awareness: Why baboons don’t wear lipstick\nDeception, in the full intentional sense, presupposes that the deceiver has a representation of the\ndeceived one’s inner environment. On this level, an animal can have goals concerning the intentions\nof other individuals, e.g., want somebody to believe that an attack would fail. This is an example of a\nsecond-order intention.\n2 Gallup (1988, p. 255) notes that “the absence of any evidence of deception in orangutans, who, like chimpanzees, can\nalso correctly decipher mirrored information about themselves, is not surprising in so much as they lead a rather solitary\nexistence in the first place. In fact, I have even conjectured [...I that the reason orangutans are so reclusive may be because\nthey have learned that other orangutans cannot be trusted!“.270 P. Giirdenfors/Behuuioural Processes 35 (1996) 263-273\nBut a smart agent will not be duped: he will realize that somebody is trying to deceive him and\ncounteract. Hence, the really smart deceiver will foresee the reasoning of such a smart agent (see\nDennett, 1988). The important aspect of this escalation in smartness is that it can only work if the\npotential deceiver realizes that the agent he wants to deceive not only has her own representations of\nthe external world, but that her inner world contains a representation of the deceiver himself.\nDo animals other than humans have self-awareness? Gallup’s experiments (Gallup, 1977) show\nthat chimpanzees and orangutans, but no other primates, can recognize themselves in mirrors ‘. And\nwhen it comes to recognizing oneself in a photograph, only chimpanzees seem to be successful.\nBodily decorations only make sense when you have some form of awareness of your own body.\nSuch decorations occur in all human cultures, but in no other species in an intentional way. Thus,\nbaboons could never come up with the idea of using lipstick.\nBut recognizing oneself in a mirror or in a photograph only requires awareness of one’s own body,\nnot of one’s own mind. The final step in the evolution of higher-level inner representation is small but\ncrucial for self-awareness in its proper sense: I must realize that the inner environment of my\nopponent does not only contain a representation of myself as a bodily agent, but as an agent with\ninner representations as well. I propose that it is only after this insight that the agent can become\nself-conscious in the sense that it can form representations of its own representations. Some support\nfor this evolutionary point can also be obtained from recent results in developmental psychology (see\ne.g. Wimmer and Hard, 1991 and Gopnik, 1993).\nAs a final step, self-awareness can then develop as a shortcut in the representations involved in the\ndeception game: I can, in my inner environment, have a representation of my own inner environment.\nHowever, I submit that this kind of self-awareness could never develop without the previous\nestablishment of a representation of the inner environment of other individuals. In other words, I\nclaim that an ‘I’-experience must be preceded by a ‘you’-experience (see also Mead, 1934,\nGardenfors, In Press, b, and Gomez, 1994). This position contradicts the traditional Cartesian view on\nmind where humans are supposed to have direct access to their thoughts 4.\n7. Language: Why bees don’t tell stories to one another\nThinking does not presume a language. Humans, as well as animals, can simulate sequences of\nactions in their inner environments. Such simulations are, among other things, necessary for planning.\nI shall argue that language is a very late phenomenon on the evolutionary scene. As I have tried to\n3 Epstein, Lanza and Skinner (Epstein et al., 1980) performed a similar experiment intending to show that also pigeons\ncan learn the same kind of behavior. Davis (1989) argues, in my opinion convincingly, that their experiment does not show\nthat pigeons have any form of self-awareness.\n4 Gopnik (1993) calls this “the illusion of expertise.” She writes: “The commonsense picture proposes that we have\nintentional psychological states, then we have psychological experiences of the intentionality of those states, then we observe\nour own behavior that follows those states, and finally, we attribute the states to others with similar behavior. I suggest a\ndifferent sequence: First we have psychological states, observe the behaviors and experiences they lead to in ourselves and\nothers, construct a theory about the causes of those behaviors and experiences that postulates intentionality, and then, in\nconsequence, we have experiences of the intentionality of those states” (1993, p.12).P. Giirdenfors / Behuuiourul Procrsses 35 (1996) 263-273 271\nshow in the previous sections, an individual can have a great deal of cognitive functions, including\nself-awareness, without having a symbolic language 5.\nIn contrast, I submit that language presumes the existence of an intricate inner environment. In\norder to make this clear, I will propose a definition of the distinction between signals and symbols.\nBoth signals and symbols are tools of communication. The fundamental difference between them is\nthat the reference of a symbol is a detached representation, while a signal refers to a cued\nrepresentation. In other words, a signal refers to something in the outer environment, while a symbol\nrefers to the inner environment. Language consists of symbols - it can be used to talk about things\nnot present in the current situation. This idea can be traced back to Hackett’s (Hackett, 1960) notion\nof ‘displacement’. Sjalander (1993, pp. 5-6) expresses the point as follows: “The predominant\nfunction of language is to communicate about that which is not here and not now. A dog can ‘say’: I\nam angry, I want water, I want to go out, I like you, etc. But it has no communicative means enabling\nit to ‘say’: I was angry yesterday, nor can it ‘say’: I will be angry if you lock me up tonight again,\nand I will chew up the carpet. Likewise, the dog can ‘say’: There is a rat here! but it cannot ‘say’:\nThere is a rat in the next room.\n[ . . . 1 Clearly, if you live in the present, communicating mainly about how you feel and what you\nwant to do in the moment, the biological signals inherent in each species are sufficient”.\nSymbols refering to something in one person’s inner environment can be used to communicate as\nsoon as the listeners have, or are prepared to add, the corresponding references in their inner\nenvironments. For a mode1 theoretic account of how such communication can be established, see\nGardenfors ( 1993).\nMany animals have intricate systems of signals, for example, the dances of bees. However, even if\ntheir dances seem to have a kind of grammar, it still consists only of signals. The bees categorize, in\na sophisticated way, places where nectar can be found. The crucial point is that they only use their\ndances in a situated manner, and thus the dances are not symbols according to my criterion. The same\npoint is made by von Glasersfeld (1976, p. 222): “In my terms, the bees do not qualify for\nsymbolicity, because they have never been observed to communicate about distances, directions, food\nsources, etc., without actually coming from, or going to, a specific location”.\nIn spite of all attempts to teach apes various forms of symbolic codes (see e.g. Savage-Rumbaugh\nand Rumbaugh, 19931, humans seem to be the only animals that use language in a fully detached way.\nEven though the pygmy chimpanzee Kanzi’s performance is quite impressive, his use of symbols is\ndependent on the context: they mainly express requests to “direct teacher’s attention to places, things\nand activities” (Savage-Rumbaugh et al., 1985, p. 658). Human children, in contrast, very early use\nlanguage outside the context of request. Vauclair (1990, p. 319) notes that “the use of symbols by\napes is closely tied to the achievement of immediate goals, because the referents occur in the context\nof behavior on their objects”. This is congenial with Gulz’ ( 1991) conclusion that only humans are\nanticipatory planners. My conjecture is that this capability is required for the complete detachment of\nlanguage. We are still waiting for Kanzi to tell us a story by the camp fire.\n’ A similar point is made by Donald (1991). In Gardenfors (In Press, a), I write: “We all have the experience of\nsomething like an omnipresent inner monologue (or dialogue) while we are engaged in thinking. I believe that this\nexperience is deceptive. Firstly, we can ‘think’ without language. Consider, for example, the previously mentioned mental\nsimulation of a high jumper. Secondly, and more importantly, the inner speech is best interpreted as just parts of the\nsimulafions in the inner environment. The inner soliloquy is part of what we perceive in the inner environment”.272 P. Giirdenfors / Behoviourul Processes 35 (1996) 263-273\n8. Conclusion: The detachment of mind\nMy main point in this paper has been to introduce the distinction between cued and detached\nrepresentations. Using this distinction as an analytic tool, I have tried to provide an outline of the\n‘later’ parts of the evolution of cognition. I have tried to show that the notion of an inner environment\ncan serve as a basis for all higher cognitive functions like planning, deception, self-awareness, and\nlanguage.\nEach of these functions is based on different kinds of assumptions concerning the detached\nrepresentations that are involved. Anticipatory planning, in contrast to immediate planning, presumes\na detachment of the representation of the needs of the individual. For deception one must postulate an\ninner environment that contains representations of other individuals’ inner environments. Self-awareness assumes detached representations of one’s own inner environment. Finally, the referents of\nlinguistic symbols are to be found in the inner environment, in contrast to signals which refer to\nthings in the actual outer environment.\nIf the behaviorists were right, it would be questionable whether we would need the notion of\nrepresentation at all (see Epstein, 1982). In my opinion, however, there is convincing evidence that\nthe behaviorists are wrong and that animals have not only cued representations but also detached\nones. I have defined the inner environment of an animal as the collection of all its detached\nrepresentations. As I have tried to show, the general trend in the evolution of cognition is that more\nand more representations become detached. This will, by large, lead to increasing cognitive flexibility.\nIn other words, the evolution of cognition is the story of the detachment of mind.\nAcknowledgements\nResearch for this article has been supported by the Swedish Council for Research in the Humanities\nand Social Sciences.

Beecher1,2\n*\n1 Department of Psychology, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, United States, 2 Department of Biology, University\nof Washington, Seattle, WA, United States\nIndividuals of some animal species have been taught simple versions of human language\ndespite their natural communication systems failing to rise to the level of a simple\nlanguage. How is it, then, that some animals can master a version of language, yet\nnone of them deploy this capacity in their own communication system? I first examine\nthe key design features that are often used to evaluate language-like properties of natural\nanimal communication systems. I then consider one candidate animal system, bird\nsong, because it has several of the key design features or their precursors, including\nsocial learning and cultural transmission of their vocal signals. I conclude that although\nbird song communication is nuanced and complex, and has the acoustic potential\nfor productivity, it is not productive – it cannot be used to say many different things.\nFinally, I discuss the debate over whether animal communication should be viewed as a\ncooperative information transmission process, as we typically view human language, or\nas a competitive process where signaler and receiver vie for control. The debate points\nto a necessary condition for the evolution of a simple language that has generally been\noverlooked: the degree of to which the interests of the signaler and receiver align. While\nstrong cognitive and signal production mechanisms are necessary pre-adaptations for\na simple language, they are not sufficient. Also necessary is the existence of identical or\nnear-identical interests of signaler and receiver and a socio-ecology that requires highlevel cooperation across a range of contexts. In the case of our hominid ancestors, these\ncontexts included hunting, gathering, child care and, perhaps, warfare. I argue that the\nkey condition for the evolution of human language was the extreme interdependency\nthat existed among unrelated individuals in the hunter-gatherer societies of our hominid\nancestors. This extreme interdependency produced multiple prosocial adaptations for\neffective intragroup cooperation, which in partnership with advanced cognitive abilities,\nset the stage for the evolution of language.\nKeywords: animal communication, language evolution, animal cognition, animal language studies, information\nINTRODUCTION\nResearch programs on animal communication systems in nature have proceeded essentially\nindependently of research programs endeavoring to teach language to animals. This is surprising\nin light of the early, well-known efforts to relate these two research streams, especially by Hockett\n(1960) and Marler (1961). These efforts spurred two questions. First, can animals be taught human\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 1 March 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 602635\nBeecher Animal Communication and Simple Language\nlanguage, even a simplified version? Second, do the natural\ncommunication systems of any animals rise to the level of\nsimple language? Research since then has indicated that these\ntwo questions may have different answers: I would suggest a\nprovisional yes to the first, and a provisional no to the second.\nIf this view is correct, it raises a further question: why, then,\nif some animals can master a version of language, don’t they\nuse this capacity in their natural communication system? In\nthis paper I address this paradox, and make some suggestions\ntoward its resolution.\nMy paper is divided into four parts. First I consider the main\n“design features” of language proposed by Hockett as a basis\nfor evaluating language-like properties of animal communication\nsystems. Hockett concluded that some animal communication\nsystems have some of these design features, but none of them\nhave all the design features, especially the key ones. I will\ndesignate an animal communication system as a ‘simple language’\nsystem using a variation on the definition of Hewes (1973):\n“language [is] any system of animal communication which\nexhibits most of the design features set forth by Hockett” (Hewes,\n1973, p. 5). I narrow this definition by identifying four design\nfeatures – semanticity, arbitrariness, learnability and cultural\ntransmission, and productivity – as necessary for the system to be\nclassified as a simple language. Second, I discuss bird song, a case\nwhere several but not all of the key design features are present. I\nwill focus on one specific case of a song-based communication\nsystem that is clearly complex and nuanced, but nevertheless\nlacks three key design features, semanticity, arbitrariness and\nproductivity. Third, I consider the debate, not yet fully concluded,\nover whether animal communication should be conceived of as a\nprocess of information transfer or as manipulation of receiver by\nthe signaler. The debate is germane to our more specific question\nbecause it provides a clue as to why we find no simple languages\namong animals despite the apparent capacity for it in at least\nsome of them. Finally, I suggest that although there appear to be\nat least some animals with the cognitive capacity for a languagelike communication system, none of them have a social system\nwith extreme interdependency among individuals on the scale of\nthat which existed in the hominid hunter-gatherer system. I argue\nthat this extreme interdependency was a necessary condition for\nthe evolution of human language.\nDESIGN FEATURES OF LANGUAGE\nIn this section I consider the extent to which the most\nimportant design features of human language are found in animal\ncommunication systems. I use Hockett’s (1960) design features\nas a basis for comparison of natural animal communication\nsystems with human language. Although Hockett’s design\nfeatures may have limited use as a theoretical framework for\nmodern evolutionary linguistics (Wacewicz and Zywiczy ˙ nski ´ ,\n2015), it is a useful starting point for the comparative analysis\nof this paper. I have winnowed Hockett’s original design features\ndown to the few I consider the most fundamental ones that\ncan be used to directly compare human language with animal\ncommunication systems.\nSpecialization: The Purpose of Linguistic\nSignals Is Communication and Not Some\nOther Biological Function\nSpecialization, in Hockett’s sense, is the first defining feature of\na communication system, no matter how simple or complex it\nmight be. Otte (1974) defines communication signals as traits\n“fashioned or maintained by natural selection because they\nconvey information to other organisms”(Otte, 1974, p. 385).\nI discuss the vigorous debate over the ‘information’ aspect\nof this definition in Section “Communication: Information or\nInfluence? Mutual Benefit or Manipulation?”, but debaters on\nboth sides would agree that this definition captures the key\ndifference between true communication signals on the one hand,\nand tactical behaviors or inadvertent cues on the other. For\nexample, while we might describe an individual delivering a\nblow to a potential opponent as ‘sending a message,’ we mean\nthis only in a metaphorical sense. This behavior is primarily\ntactical, that is, the individual delivering the blow will directly\nbenefit it if its opponent responds by backing down. If instead of\ndelivering a blow the individual had said “I’m going to kill you,”\nor growled, or barked, or hissed, we would recognize these as true\ncommunication signals, having been shaped by natural selection\nfor the purpose of (literally) sending a message, and requiring\nadaptations in the receiver as well.\nHockett listed prevarication – the ability to transmit\nmisinformation, i.e., to lie or deceive – as one of his many\ndesign features, albeit a minor one, a corollary almost. In\nSection “Communication: Information or Influence? Mutual\nBenefit or Manipulation?”, I will argue that we should consider\nprevarication to be a fundamental, indeed foundational feature\nof animal communication systems: communication in animals\nis shaped by the tension between the sender’s and receiver’s\ninterests, and truth in communication is not a given, but rather,\nwhen it occurs, hard won.\nSemanticity: Specific Signals Are Directly\nTied to Certain Meanings\nTo say that a communication system is semantic is to say that\nit uses signals to represent particular things or actions. A wellknown example in animals are alarm signals given in response to\ndifferent predators. We can say in such cases that each of these\nsignals represents one of several different predators, or more\nprecisely, the appearance on the scene of one of these predators.\nFor example, vervet monkeys have three different alarm calls for\nthree different classes of predators: raptors, terrestrial mammals\nand snakes, predators which depend on an element of surprise\nto capture the monkey. In response to an aerial predator, such\nas a martial eagle, a monkey emits ‘cough’ calls and sender and\nreceivers take shelter in dense bushes or near the core of a tree.\nIn response to leopards, a monkey emits a ‘bark’ call and the\nmonkeys climb up to the tip of tree branches where leopards\ncannot safely go. Finally, if a monkey spots a dangerous snake,\nsuch as a python, it emits a ‘chutter’ call and the group gathers\naround the snake, standing upright and harassing it until it leaves\nthe area. Although the vervets use these same signals in other\ncontexts (e.g., intergroup fights) to represent different things,\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 2 March 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 602635\nBeecher Animal Communication and Simple Language\nthe modification of signal meaning in different contexts occurs\nin human language as well, and does not negatively impact the\nrepresentational quality of these signals (Seyfarth et al., 1990;\nPrice et al., 2015). Indeed, it is not unusual for an animal to use\na particular signal to mean different things in different contexts\n(Smith, 1997), similar to some words meaning totally different\nthings within different sentences.\nNevertheless, I will argue later in this paper that the\nsemanticity of animal communication systems is limited:\nalthough some things are represented by animal signals, the\nnumber of things is generally small. Attempts to catalog the\nnumber of different things signaled in animal communication\nsystems typically top out at 25 or so (vervet monkeys, Struhsaker,\n1967; Japanese macaques, Green, 1975; review in Hauser, 2000).\nThe limitation does not appear to be due to production\nconstraints (the ability to produce enough distinct signals or\nto recombine enough of them to enlarge the signal set) or to\nperceptual-cognitive constraints.\nArbitrariness: Languages Are Made Up\nof Arbitrary Symbols Which Have No\nIntrinsic or Logical Connection to What\nThey Represent\nA distinctive feature of human language is that not only are\nwords semantic, they are arbitrarily so. We could equally well\ncall dogs ‘cats’ and cats ‘dogs,’ or any other two words, so long\nas sender and receiver knew the convention, a point illustrated by\nthe existence of the many different languages of the world. These\nsignals seem totally arbitrary with respect to what they signify,\nand in theory they could be interchanged without problems, so\nlong as senders and receivers were both aware of the convention.\nHow about animal signals? It appears that in theory we could\ninterchange the vervet alarm signals without problems, provided\nof course that the receivers were aware of the ‘convention’ (i.e.,\nwere hard-wired appropriately). Identity signals – indicating\nspecies or individual identity, and occasionally group or kinship –\nare perhaps the most common animals signals that unequivocally\nhave the arbitrariness feature.\nBut many, perhaps most, animal signals are not arbitrary.\nSignals used in agonistic and mate attraction contexts are\ntypically “more of ” signals, i.e., more effective signals are louder,\nlonger, bigger, brighter, flashier, designed to impress or to shock\nand awe. I am unaware of any clear example where the reverse\nis true, where the more effective signal is the one that is less\nconspicuous, for example, a softer sound, a more subdued color,\na less vigorous display. An apparent exception might be the\n‘quiet song’ sung by many songbirds in intense conflict situations,\nbut this typically happens only when the bird is close to its\nopponent so that the quiet song is audible to the receiver (Searcy\net al., 2014); ‘normal’ song is loud because it is a long-distance\nsignal. Moreover, quiet song is typically different in other respects\nbesides loudness, for example, having some elements seen only in\nquiet song, such as very high frequency elements.\nOther animal signals are simple extensions or slight\nmodifications of tactical behaviors, e.g., of attack behavior in\nagonistic situations. For example, a threat signal in many\nmammals is the open mouth display, where the teeth, the\ncanines notably, are prominently displayed. Ethologists called\nthis a ‘ritualized’ display (Lorenz, 1966), i.e., one that has\nbeen modified by natural selection to be a display, since the\nmouth is held open, and attack withheld, rather than being\nthe beginning of an actual attack. Another common threat\nsignal is the raising of the hair or feathers, making the animal\nappear larger. Again, while these actions are plausibly considered\nritualized displays, they are not arbitrary signals. If they were,\nyou would also find cases where animals threaten by closing\ntheir mouths, or by making themselves appear small. In short,\nanimal signals functioning to impress an opponent or potential\nmating partner are usually inherently impressive, not arbitrarily\nselected to represent threat or desirability. Any naïve observer\nviewing a ritualized dominance interaction between two wolves\n(or dogs) would have no difficulty determining which animal was\ndominant and which was subordinate. An upright animal, with its\nhair raised, its tail raised, and staring at its opponent inherently\nappears dominant, whereas one with a flattened, slinking body,\nhair down, tail down, and looking away from the opponent,\ninherently appears subordinate.\nMany epigamic signals – signals designed to attract a mate\nand induce her to mate – are bright, striking ornaments, often\nones that function like supernormal stimuli (e.g., the tail of\nthe long-tailed widowbird, Andersson, 1982). Many epigamic\nsignals are energetically expensive and highly skilled behaviors,\nsuch as the complex male courtship dances of wolf spiders and\njumping spiders (Hebets and Uetz, 1999; Elias et al., 2012). The\nmotor performance revealed in these sorts of displays likely\nreflect whole-organism performance relating to survival, and thus\nshould be good indicators of individual signaler quality. There is\nconsiderable evidence that females choose mates in nature based\nupon their evaluations of male motor performance (reviewed\nin Byers et al., 2010). The relevant point here is that these\nsignals are not arbitrary, but inherently reflect the trait signaled:\nsignaler quality.\nEven in the example par excellence of communication of\ninformation about the external world – the honeybee dance\nlanguage – the signals are not quite so arbitrary as generally\nassumed. For example, if the dance is done outside the hive,\nwhere the sun is visible, the bee dances with respect to the\nactual position of the sun, rather than with respect to the vertical\n(Gould, 1975). That is, outside the hive, the symbology is not truly\narbitrary. Moreover, the distance to the target is represented by\nthe duration of the straight run – the further the distance, the\nlonger the run – so this is at least partially non-arbitrary as well.\nAlthough the words in human language are arbitrary – the\nexistence of different languages is the clearest evidence on\nthis point – they may be expressed in such a way to amplify\nor otherwise modify their meaning, as for example a loudly\nshouted “no” indicating stronger conviction. But what would\nbe considered an extra-linguistic feature for humans is often\nthe primary message in animals. For example, the initial stage\nof a battle between two male red deer consists of a roaring\ncontest (Clutton-Brock and Albon, 1979). This vocal signaling\nduel does far more than simply establish that each animal is a\nmale conspecific ready to defend or fight for the harem – this\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 3 March 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 602635\nBeecher Animal Communication and Simple Language\nundoubtedly was perceived by both parties before the contest\nbegan – rather, how loud and how long an individual roars\nestablishes how motivated and formidable he is, and is used by\nthe receiver to decide whether to continue the fight or depart.\nSimilarly, the plumage ornaments and courtship dance of a male\ngolden-collared manakin do far more than simply identify species\nand sex – that is simply the necessary first step – the brightness\nof the ornament and the skill of the dance determine whether the\nreceiver, the female, will choose to mate with this particular male\nor continue her search for the best possible mate (Stein and Uy,\n2006; Barske et al., 2011).\nIn summary, although we have examples of animal signals that\nare totally arbitrary, many others – perhaps most? – are not. I\nwould add that to date we have found nothing comparable to the\nmany different human languages, which are a consequence of the\narbitrariness feature. We do find geographical dialects in animals\n(e.g., Marler and Tamura, 1964; Wright and Dahlin, 2018), but\nas the name implies, these are relatively minor variations on\nthe basic signal set, nothing like the wholesale variation seen in\nhuman languages.\nLearnability and Cultural Transmission\nHuman language is both learned and taught. Most animal\ncommunication systems are neither. A well-known exception to\nthis generalization are the learned vocal communication signals\nof several taxa, most notably the oscine passerines (songbirds),\nhummingbirds and parrots among birds, and cetaceans and at\nleast some bat species among mammals (reviews in Janik, 2014;\nKnornschild, 2014; Nowicki and Searcy, 2014). Evidence for\nvocal learning and cultural transmission in some other birds\nand mammals as well (Walcott et al., 2006; Kroodsma et al.,\n2013; Stoeger and Manger, 2014; Garland and McGregor, 2020;\nBarker et al., 2021) suggests that this ability may lie closer to\nthe surface than is generally assumed, but at least at the present\ntime, vocal learning is thought to be rare in animals. Later in this\npaper I return to the best-studied example of vocal learning, song\nlearning in songbirds.\nWhere the communication signals are learned, we should\nexpect to find dialects, geographical variation in the signals.\nThe occurrence of dialects is one criterion for identifying\nthe occurrence of learning and potentially evidence for the\narbitrariness design feature. An example that may illustrate\nthe arbitrary nature of dialects is the recently-discovered\nmodification of the song in eastern white-throated sparrows to\nresemble the typical song of western white-throated sparrows.\nInvestigators have traced this change to eastern birds learning\nthe western version of the song on the migration grounds, where\nindividuals of the two populations mix (Otter et al., 2020). Most\neastern birds now sing the ‘western’ version of the song on\nthe breeding grounds, illustrating that the details of the song\nstructure are not crucial for its function. Although Otter et al.\n(2020) suggest that this change might have been driven by a\npreference on the part of eastern females, they give no evidence\nfor this hypothesis, nor plausible basis for it.\nPerhaps even rarer in animal communication systems than\nlearning is teaching. The commonly accepted criteria for\ndemonstrating teaching in non-human animals are that (1)\nteachers should modify their behavior in the presence of the\nlearner, (2) this change in behavior should result in no immediate\nbenefit to the teacher, and (3) the learner should acquire a\nbehavior quicker or better as a result (Caro and Hauser, 1992).\nIn song-learning studies the birds from whom the young bird\nlearns its song are conventionally referred to as ‘tutors,’ and\nalthough live birds are invariably more effective song tutors\nthan recorded song (review in Beecher, 2017), the term ‘tutor’\nis used purely as matter of convenience. In fact, in the most\ncommon context for song learning in nature, young birds learn\nfrom older birds who are or will be their territorial rivals, a\nvery different context from language learning in young humans,\nwhere ‘tutors’ are typically relatives or other interested parties\nwho ultimately (but not immediately) benefit from tutoring.\nNevertheless, even in the common songbird case where the young\nbird learns from territorial rivals, bird song tutoring would fit\nall three criteria for teaching if in fact the older bird reduces\nhis usual aggression when a young bird appears on his territory,\nincreases his counter-singing with the young bird in such a way\nas to facilitate learning, and benefits down the road from this\ntutoring (for example, the two cooperate in mutual defense of\ntheir territories, or against predators, or refrain from extra-pair\nmating with one another’s mates). We have indirect evidence\nfor song learning/teaching in song sparrows: mutual survival\nis greater in young birds and their primary tutor-neighbor\n(the one from whom they learn most of their songs) the more\nsongs the two of them ultimately share, i.e., the more songs\nthe tutee learned from the tutor, or the tutor taught the tutee\n(Beecher et al., 2020).\nProductivity: By Combining a Small\nNumber of Meaningless Units Into\nLarger Meaningful Signals, a Sender Is\nCapable of Producing Meaningful\nStatements About Virtually Anything\nThe sense in which I am using this term is captured by\nHauser (2000, p. 448): “the power of [human] language comes\nfrom our capacity to take meaningless syllables and combine\nthem into an unbounded number of meaningful words, and\nthen take these words and combine them into an unbounded\nnumber of meaningful expressions (Chomsky, 1986; StuddertKennedy, 1998).” I will define productivity as recombining\na smaller number of basic signal units to produce a larger\nnumber of signals, and thus, messages. Indeed, semanticity\n(representation) and productivity are probably the two central\nfeatures of human language: by combining basic phonetic units\ninto larger meaningful units, and combining these units further\nvia syntactical rules, we can say almost anything.\nAnimal communication systems are not productive in this\nsense, and this is the primary reason we do not refer to them\nas languages. We would be impressed if a vervet could say\nsomething like “Grab your infant and run from the leopard\ncoming from the west but watch out for the python who\nlikes to hide in the bushes just to the east of you.” A human\ncan say this kind of thing easily, combining a relatively small\nnumber of atomic units (phonemes) into very large number of\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 4 March 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 602635\nBeecher Animal Communication and Simple Language\nbasic signals (words) and combining these into a very large set\nof possible communications. I note that while there is some\ncontroversy in phonetics about exactly what are the units of\nproductive combination, there is agreement that all natural\nlanguages (including sign language) are made up of meaningless\natomic units that are combined into larger meaningful wholes\n(Zuidema and de Boer, 2009).\nInstead of productivity, we could describe the communication\nsystem in terms of information capacity. The information\ncapacity of human language is essentially infinite, in the sense\nthat, in theory, we can communicate virtually anything. Our\nmotor, sensory and cognitive capacities obviously will reduce\nhow much information actually gets transmitted and received.\nBut still, the fact is that we can transmit an enormous amount\nof information with language. Attempts to measure information\ncapacity or information transmission in animals, on the other\nhand, have given rather modest results. Two estimates of the\ninformation about distance and direction in the honeybee dance\nlanguage have given a high value of 14.9 bits (Gould, 1975)\nand a low value of 7.4 bits (Schürch and Ratnieks, 2015). My\ngroup has estimated the information capacity of the call signature\nsystem that parents of the colonial cliff swallow use to find their\noffspring in their large breeding colonies (Medvin et al., 1993).\nWe estimated the capacity as 8.76 bits, and the estimate would be\nsomewhat larger if we included information that can be derived\nfrom visual differences among cliff swallow chicks (Stoddard and\nBeecher, 1983). The information capacity of human language of\ncourse is orders of magnitude larger than this.\nWe certainly find the potential for productivity in bird\nsong. For example, most songbirds have multiple songs (song\n‘repertoires’), and the different songs are made up of different\nsyllables or notes in different orders, and these smaller units can\nbe used in more than one song. Still, although the units are there,\nand although songbirds may possess the cognitive capacity to\ncomprehend hierarchical structuring in vocal signals (Gentner\net al., 2006; but see van Heijningen et al., 2009), they do not\nuse these capacities to form different songs representing different\nthings. As Hauser (2000, p. 450) puts it, “in contrast to the\nrecombination of words into sentences by humans, the output of\nsongbird recombination does not change its meaning.” A minor\nexception are some songbirds who use some song types in a\nterritorial defense context and others in a mate attraction context\n(e.g., Byers, 1996). As discussed in the next section, theories on\nthe function of song repertoires abound, but they all agree that\nthe different songs function simply to provide diversity, rather\nthan to represent different things.\nSumming Up\nTable 1 summarizes the conclusions of this section. The natural\ncommunication systems of animals fall short of human language\non a number of the key design features of language. They\ncome closest on semanticity, where signals sometimes represent\nthings in the external world or within the signaler, and the\nsignals are sometimes truly arbitrary. However, more commonly\nanimal signals are not arbitrary but inherently meaningful,\ne.g., an animal making itself appear large is more frightening\nthan an animal making itself appear small. Most animal\ncommunication signals and responses are neither learned nor\nculturally transmitted. And, so far as we know, no animal\ncommunication has the sine qua non of language: productivity.\nBIRD SONG: COMPLEXITY WITHOUT\nPRODUCTIVITY\nThe oscine passerines (songbirds) are one of the rare animal taxa\nin which individuals learn their vocal communication signals.\nIn most animals, these vocal signals are ‘hard-wired,’ that is,\nthey develop normally whether or not the animal is exposed to\nthem early in life. It has long been noted that vocal learning in\nsongbirds has many similarities to language learning in humans\n(Marler, 1970; Doupe and Kuhl, 1999). These similarities include\nthe following. (1) The young bird needs to be exposed to normal\nspecies vocal signals in order to produce them as an adult. (2)\nThe sensory phase of song learning precedes the motor phase.\n(3) Auditory feedback (which can be abolished by deafening) is\nTABLE 1 | Key design features of communication systems (after Hockett, 1960, pruned and combined).\nFound in\nanimals?\nDesign feature Comment\nYes Specialization. The purpose of linguistic signals is communication and not some\nother biological function.\nTrue of animal communication systems, but this is essentially by\ndefinition.\nYes but\nlimited\nSemanticity. Specific signals are directly tied to certain meanings. Clear example are the alarm calls given to different classes of\npredators in a number of species. But the number of different things\nsignaled is typically very small.\nYes but\nrare\nArbitrariness. There is an arbitrary relationship between a signal and its\nmeaning. There is no inherent relationship between the form of a signal and\nwhat it refers to.\nAnimal signals are sometimes arbitrary. Often they have inherent\nmeaning that can be readily perceived by a naïve observer, e.g.,\nsignals used in mate attraction or agonistic encounters that are\ndesigned to impress or shock and awe.\nYes but\nrare\nLearnability and Cultural transmission. Human language is learnable, teachable and culturally transmitted.\nBird song appears to be one of the few animal examples that\npasses at least two of these criteria (teaching still not established).\nNo Productivity (based on Arbitrariness, Discreteness and Duality of patterning):\nlanguage made up of small meaningless units which can be combined into\nmany larger meaningful units which can be combined to say virtually anything.\nSome animals appear to have the motor and cognitive capacity for\na productive, language-like communication system but they do not\nuse this capacity to develop language-like communication systems.\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 5 March 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 602635\nBeecher Animal Communication and Simple Language\nnecessary for the translation of memorized sensory input into\nmotor production. (4) Vocal learning is most efficient in (and\nsometimes restricted to) a sensitive period early in life. (5) There\nare specialized parts of the brain dedicated to the vocal control\nsystem. (6) Song is socially learned and culturally transmitted,\nand in at least some cases it may be actively taught (e.g., CarousoPeck and Goldstein, 2019; Beecher et al., 2020). While notable\ndifferences exist among songbird species with regard to the\nnormal progression of song learning (Beecher and Brenowitz,\n2005), these six features are essentially true for all of the many\nsongbirds that have been studied to date.\nDespite the notable parallels between bird song learning\nand human language learning, none of the many studies\nendeavoring to teach a version of human language to animals\nhave focused on songbirds. This is all the more surprising\ngiven the language learning shown by Alex the African Gray\nParrot, a member of another avian taxon with vocal learning, the\npsittacines (Pepperberg, 1981, 1987). Moreover, songbirds have\nstrong cognitive capacities, a highly-developed vocal production\nmechanism, and a vocabulary of basic sound units in their\nsong that rivals or exceeds the basic sound units of human\nlanguage. There are even songbird species that can mimic human\nspeech sounds (e.g., Hill Mynah birds). On the face of it, all the\nrequisites would seem to be there to support a simple language\nin a songbird.\nWhat Is the Function of a Song\nRepertoire?\nIn contrast to well-studied white-crowned sparrows and zebra\nfinches, in most songbird species an individual bird will sing\nmultiple songs (has a song ‘repertoire’). For example, song\nsparrows typically have nine (plus or minus two or so) very\ndifferent songs. Each of these songs is made up of 5 or 6 distinct\nelements, and the order of these elements is important (Horning\net al., 1993). The songs do not have individual signatures and\nthe nine or so songs in a song sparrow’s repertoire are as\ndifferent among themselves as would be a collection of songs\ntaken at random one from each of nine or so different birds\n(Beecher et al., 1994). Song sparrows are somewhere on the\nmiddle of the song repertoire complexity scale: many species\nhave larger and even more complex song repertoires. The key\npoint for this discussion is that song repertoires provide clear\npotential for productivity, as song sparrows and many other\nsongbirds have as many or more distinct units in their vocal\ncommunication systems (e.g., about 100 in indigo buntings,\nThompson, 1970; and in swamp sparrows, Marler and Pickert,\n1984) as there are in human language (a typical language has\n40–45 phonemes).\nThe most popular hypothesis about song repertoires for north\ntemperate zone songbirds – where only males sing – is that\nthey are an epigamic signal produced by males to attract females\nand that larger repertoires are more attractive than smaller\nones (Catchpole, 1987; Searcy and Yasukawa, 1996; MacDougallShackleton, 1997; Collins, 2004). Focusing on just the wellstudied song sparrow, the evidence for this hypothesis is mixed\n(Searcy, 1984; Reid et al., 2004; Hill C. E. et al., 2011). The\nhandicap principle, discussed in the next section, would suggest\nthat if large song repertoires are preferred, it is because they are an\nindicator of some aspect of male quality. Reid et al. (2005) found\nsupport for this idea: song repertoire size in male song sparrows\ncorrelated with enhanced cell-mediated immune response (CMI)\nand relative heterozygosity. Anderson et al. (2017) hypothesized\nthat female song sparrows might prefer large-repertoire males\nbecause this feature is an indicator the overall learning ability\nof the male. However, they found no correlations between\nrepertoire size (or two other measures of song learning ability)\nwith an overall measure of learning ability (based on five different\nlearning tasks). I should note, however, that a correlation of vocal\nlearning ability with both overall learning ability and mating\nsuccess has been found in another songbird, the Satin Bowerbird,\na vocal mimic: in this case the vocal learning ability is the ability\nof males to mimic the calls of other local bird species, both the\nnumber of species mimicked, and the accuracy of the mimicry\n(Coleman et al., 2007; Keagy et al., 2009).\nAccording to another hypothesis, song repertoires play\na role in territorial competition, which in north temperate\nzone songbirds, where only males sing, is largely male-male\ncompetition, but outside the north temperate zone where both\nsexes sing, is pair-pair competition (e.g., Levin, 1996; Langmore,\n1998; Logue and Gammon, 2004). There are several hypotheses\nas to how repertoires might work in the territorial competition\ncontext. Song is used by most territorial songbirds at least in\npart as a keep-out signal, to ‘post’ their territory. Kroodsma\n(1988) argues that the vocal diversity provided by a repertoire\nfunctions to hold the attention of territorial competitors by\ndishabituating them to the territory owner’s singing, i.e., by\nholding their attention. As one piece of evidence, he points to\na positive correlation between repertoire size and population\ndensity in marsh wren populations, and also to the finding that\nbirds in denser populations cycle through their songs faster,\nagain a behavior that should reduce habituation (Kroodsma,\n1977). In contrast, song sparrows sing their much smaller\nrepertoires with eventual variety, i.e., singing each one of\ntheir song types many times before switching to another\ntype, and this would seem to argue against the dishabituation\nhypothesis. In western, resident populations of song sparrows,\nsong repertoires may function primarily to provide a bird with\nsongs matching all (or most) of his neighbors, and thus potential\nindividualized replies to each one of them (Beecher et al., 1997;\nand see next section).\nAlthough as this brief discussion indicates, the theoretical\ndebate has not yet concluded, the take-away point is that\nnone of these hypotheses view song repertoires as a form of\nsemantic communication. Rather they view repertoires as having\na direct effect on the receiver (dishabituation), or as permitting\nindividualized replies to multiple neighbors, or as quantitative\nsignals with inherent rather than semantic meaning, that is, more\nsongs (or more song syllables) are simply more effective.\nI should add that most single-song species appear to have\nthe potential to develop song repertoires yet do not tap into\nthis potential. For example, when examined over an entire\npopulation, indigo buntings have a repertoire of over a 100\ndistinct song syllables, yet a given individual uses just 6–8 of\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 6 March 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 602635\nBeecher Animal Communication and Simple Language\nthese in the single song it develops (Rice and Thompson, 1968;\nThompson, 1969; Baker and Boylan, 1995).\nAn Example: Communication in a\nNegotiation Context\nAlthough the different songs in a bird’s repertoire do not have\ndifferent meanings, a bird having a song repertoire can still use\nthe different songs to communicate in more subtle, nuanced\nways than might at first be suspected. In this section I describe\none such case: how song sparrows use the songs in their song\nrepertoire to negotiate territorial disputes. The general point I will\nmake is that their communication system is surprisingly complex\nand versatile, despite being neither semantic nor productive.\nAlthough I will not attempt to generalize to all songbirds given\nthe incredible diversity of the song communication systems seen\nin this group (Beecher and Brenowitz, 2005), I suspect that this\nconclusion – complexity without productivity – applies broadly\nto songbirds, and perhaps to all animals.\nSong sparrows have a territorial system like that found in\nmany animals and typical of many songbirds. An individual\ncarves out a territory where the mated pair will nest and\nraise their young, doing most of their feeding on the territory.\nSuitable habitat is typically densely occupied by conspecifics,\nso territorial disputes can arise during both the establishment\nand maintenance stages. The relationship between territorial\nneighbors can become relatively non-hostile once established,\nhowever, on the principle that the enemy you know is better\nthan the enemy you don’t know, generally referred to as the\n‘Dear Enemy’ relationship (Fisher, 1954; Akçay et al., 2009,\n2010; Beecher and Akçay, 2014). Because in territorial animals,\nneighbors have no fences, neighbors need to renegotiate territory\nboundaries from time to time. Negotiation can progress into\nfighting but avoiding fighting may benefit both parties and this\ncommon interest favors reliable signaling. Therefore, as I will\ndiscuss in Section “Communication: Information or Influence?\nMutual Benefit or Manipulation?”, we should expect to find some\ndegree of honest communication concerning not only fighting\nability (resource-holding potential) but also motivation to fight\n(e.g., at a particular point in time, one party may have more to\nlose than the other).\nSong sparrows in western, resident populations use their\nrepertoires in a complex way to carry out territory negotiations.\nAlthough they will engage in serious fights, established neighbors\nuse their signaling system to avoid fighting if possible. Before\nfighting they typically give their high-level threat signals, wing\nwaves and soft song (Searcy and Beecher, 2009; Searcy et al., 2014;\nAkçay et al., 2015a). But before reaching this stage, they use the\nsongs in their repertoires to escalate or de-escalate the dispute\nfollowing a set of ‘conventions’ predicated on which songs the two\nbirds happen to share (Beecher et al., 1996, 2000; Burt et al., 2001,\n2002; Beecher and Campbell, 2005; Akçay et al., 2011; Templeton\net al., 2012; Akçay et al., 2013, 2015b). Because western song\nsparrows learn songs from their neighbors in the area to which\nthey disperse after fledging, a bird typically shares some of his\nsongs with each of his immediate neighbors. The set of songs\nhe shares with one neighbor is typically different from the set\nhe shares with another. A partial example is shown in Figure 1.\nFor example, if we represent the different songs of a bird with\ndifferent capital letters, and the shared songs of neighbors with\nthe same capital letter, then Bird 1 might share his song types\nA, B, and C with his neighbor Bird 2, his song types C, D, and\nE with another neighbor, his song types E and F with a third\nneighbor, and finally G, H, and I with no neighbors (e.g., the\nbird he learned these songs from may have died). A typical\nterritorial negotiation might occur as follows. Suppose Bird 1’s\nmate finds an ideal place to build her nest just over the previouslyestablished boundary with Bird 2. Bird 1, aiming to establish this\nnew boundary, moves to that point and sings at his neighbor.\nTypically the two birds would still be a considerable distance\napart at this point and out of sight of one another (territories are\nlarge and song is a long-distance signal). Although Bird 1 could\nsing any one of his 9 songs to Bird 2, in this circumstance he\nwould typically ‘address’ Bird 2 by singing one of their shared\ntypes, A, B, or C. Let us say bird 1 sings B. Bird 2 can escalate\nby replying with his B’ (i.e., his most similar song to Bird 1’s B).\nThis ‘type match’ is a low-level threat signal and would be the\nfirst step in escalation. Alternatively, he could ‘confirm’ without\nescalating by replying with A’ or C’ (‘repertoire matches’, Beecher\net al., 1996). Note that this type of reply is only possible if Bird 2\nknows Bird 1 well enough to know which songs they share and\nwhich songs they don’t. Finally, rather than type-matching or\nrepertoire-matching, Bird 2 can de-escalate by singing one of his\nunshared types, e.g., D, E, F, G, H or I. Singing an unshared type\nis better than not singing at all because it signals that although\nthe singer is not engaging, he is on territory and has heard his\nneighbor; it is a signal likely used for example when the bird is\nbusy feeding recently-fledged young. If Bird 2 does type match\nbird 1 (sings B’), Bird 1 in turn can continue to sing that song\ntype (‘stay on type’), or he can de-escalate by switching to another\nshared song (A or C, ‘repertoire match’), or de-escalate further by\nswitching to an unshared type (e.g., D or E), or disengage totally\nby stopping singing.\nEach ‘convention’ – type matching, repertoire matching,\nstaying on type, switching to an unshared type – has a distinct\nsignaling function in this graded signaling system, with both type\nmatching and staying on type when type-matched signaling a\nreadiness to escalate, repertoire matching signaling recognition of\nthe sender and engagement but stopping short of escalation, and\nswitching to an unshared type signaling de-escalation. The system\nwhile not in itself resolving anything, does give the neighbors\ntime to defuse the situation or work out a compromise. Note,\nhowever, that the semantic content is limited. No particular song\nin the repertoire means a particular thing. A song’s meaning is\ndefined entirely by the context of who the receiver is, and even\nthen there are essentially only three meanings, roughly ‘back off,’\n‘I hear you and know who you are,’ and ‘I’m busy now.’\nSumming Up\nSongbirds check several of the design feature boxes and they\nwould appear to have the potential to use their songs in a\nproductive way, i.e., to use their signaling system to say many\nthings. However, despite considerable debate concerning the\nfunction of song repertoires, the different repertoire hypotheses\nall agree on one point: that the function of the vocal diversity\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 7 March 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 602635\nBeecher Animal Communication and Simple Language\nFIGURE 1 | Partial song repertoires of two neighboring birds. Shared songs are shown in the top three rows, and four of their unshared songs in the bottom two\nrows (they are arbitrarily paired). Frequency scale: 0–10 kHz. Songs are 2–3 s long.\nis diversity per se, not the transmission of different messages\nwith different songs. Perhaps even more surprising, many singlesong species have large song syllable repertoires an individual\ncould tap into, but instead each individual uses just several\nof these syllables to develop its single song. No songbird\nrearranges its multiple song syllables into different songs that\nsignal different things. I echo here the conclusion of Fitch and\nJarvis (2013, p. 502): although songbirds (and parrots) have vocal\nlearning and a complex vocal repertoire, they do not “use their\nsongs to communicate combinatorial propositional meanings,\ni.e., semantics.”. Songbirds may use their repertoires in subtle,\nnuanced ways, as with the song sparrow hierarchical signaling\nsystem I described above, but what the system achieves seems\nbetter described as the management of behavioral conflict than\nas an impressive transmission of information. That is, the system\nmay function well, but it does not function like a language.\nCOMMUNICATION: INFORMATION OR\nINFLUENCE? MUTUAL BENEFIT OR\nMANIPULATION?\nIn this section I discuss the debate within the field about\nthe fundamental nature of animal communication. I believe\nthis debate has provided us with a key to understanding\nwhy we find no examples of a simple language among the\nmany communication systems of non-human animals, and true\nlanguage only in the human animal.\nWe can trace the real beginning of the field of animal\ncommunication to the classical ethologists (e.g., Tinbergen,\n1952). The ethologists provided detailed descriptions of animal\nsignaling systems in nature, developed theories about the\nunderlying proximate causes (e.g., sign stimuli, innate release\nmechanisms, and fixed action patterns) and evolutionary\nprocesses (e.g., ritualization), and most relevant here, established\nthe view of animal communication as – like human language –\nan information transfer process. On the question of the function\nof animal signaling systems, they took a group-selectionist\nperspective: the benefit that a signaling system provided went not\nto signaler or receiver per se, but to the species (see Tinbergen,\n1964 definition in Table 2).\nFollowing the revolution of the 1960’s and 1970’s first known\nas sociobiology (Wilson, 1975) and subsequently as behavioral\necology (Krebs and Davies, 1978), natural selection came to be\nviewed as acting on individuals, rather than species or groups\n(Williams, 1966). For some researchers, the shift from naïve\ngroup selection to individual selection did not entail a significant\nchange in view: it was simply assumed that signaler and receiver\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 8 March 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 602635\nBeecher Animal Communication and Simple Language\nTABLE 2 | Definitions.\nTinbergen, 1964 “One party. . . emits a signal, while the other party. . . responds in such a way that the welfare of the species is\npromoted.”\nMarler, 1968 In “true communication. . . both parties seek to maximize the efficiency of information transfer.”\nOtte, 1974, p. 385 Signals: “behavioral, physiological, or morphological characteristics fashioned or maintained by natural selection\nbecause they convey information to other organisms”\nDawkins and Krebs, 1978, p. 283 “Communication is said to occur when an animal, the actor, does something which appears to be the result of selection\nto influence the sense organs of another animal, the reactor, so that the reactor’s behavior changes to the advantage of\nthe actor.”\nGreen and Marler, 1979, p. 73 “Communication consists of the transmission of information from one animal to another.”\nKrebs and Dawkins, 1984, p. 401 They call the sender role the ‘manipulator’ and the receiver role the ‘mind-reader.’ “The manipulator role is selected to\nalter the behavior of others to its advantage, the mind-reader role to anticipate the future behavior of others.”\nSmith, 1997, p. 11 Communication: “any sharing of information between entities—in social animals, between individual animals”\nBradbury and Vehrencamp, 1998, p. 3 True communication: “information exchange from which both sender and receiver benefit.”\nMaynard Smith and Harper, 2003, p. 3 A signal is “any act or structure that alters the behavior of other organisms, which evolved because of that effect, and\nwhich is effective because the receiver’s response has also evolved.”\nOwren et al., 2010, p. 771 Animal Signaling: “the use of specialized, species-typical morphology or behavior to influence the current or future\nbehavior of another individual.”\nboth benefited from the transmission of information, and so\nthis basic parallel with human language was maintained (see\nTable 2 definitions of Marler, 1968; Otte, 1974). The assumption\nof mutual benefit seemed natural in cases where sender and\nreceiver have a strong common interest, e.g., the honeybee ‘dance\nlanguage’ where scout and recruit are both working toward the\nsame end, to provide food for their relatives in the hive. But as\ninvestigators began considering the many cases where signaler\nand receiver have conflicting interests, such as in agonistic\nencounters over an indivisible resource, they began to question\nthe mutual-benefit, information transmission view. They asked\ntwo questions about such cases. First, do both parties have to\nbenefit? Second, do we need to even talk about ‘information\ntransmission’? Isn’t the signaler simply selected to manipulate\n(or influence) the behavior of the receiver to its advantage? The\nmanipulation viewpoint was famously developed by Dawkins and\nKrebs (1978) who argued that rather than expecting signalers to\nsignal honestly, we should expect them to manipulate the receiver\nto their own advantage, e.g., to convince opponents to retreat, or\npotential partners to mate with them.\nSince the Dawkins and Krebs (1978) paper, the debate\nhas continued as to whether it is justified or productive to\nconceptualize animal signaling as an information transmission\nprocess in which both parties benefit. Simplifying somewhat,\nI will distinguish between the Information Transmission and\nManipulation approaches to animal communication. Strong\narguments on the manipulation side since Dawkins and Krebs\n(1978) include Krebs and Dawkins (1984), Owings and Morton\n(1998), Scott-Phillips (2008), Rendall et al. (2009), and Owren\net al. (2010). Strong arguments on the information side over this\nsame period include Green and Marler (1979), Smith (1997),\nBradbury and Vehrencamp (1998), Searcy and Nowicki (2005),\nCarazo and Font (2010), Seyfarth et al. (2010), and Wiley (2013).\nDefinitions from some of these sources are included in Table 2.\nIn conceiving of signaling as manipulation, Dawkins and\nKrebs (1978) essentially treated the communication interaction\nlike a zero-sum game. This seems reasonable in cases like disputes\nover an indivisible resource (a food item, a territory, and a\nmate), and also in epigamic selection, where a male tries to\npersuade a female to mate with him now rather than to continue\nsearching for a possibly better male. Although the manipulation\nview was enlightening in many respects, as originally presented\nit had a serious weakness: it gave no agency to the receiver.\nWhile it was sensible to expect signalers to signal for their own\nbenefit, why should we expect receivers to be passive in these\nevolutionary scenarios, especially if being manipulated by the\nsignaler is costly? Rather, we should expect receivers to show\n‘sales resistance’ to signals that carry misinformation or are pure\npropaganda (“I am the best,” “I will fight you to death”). Indeed,\nreceivers can do more than simply ignore signals that do not\nbenefit them: they can require signals that do benefit them, even\nif those signals are costly to the sender. For example, in many\nspecies males must sing or call to attract a female for mating. If\nthe male does not vocalize, potential female receivers will simply\nnot engage. Moreover, these vocal signals may attract predators,\na cost borne by the signaler but not the receiver. Indeed, the\nmost effective or most-preferred signals may be the most costly,\ne.g., most conspicuous not just to the intended receiver but to\npredators as well. This is the case for a male túngara frog (Ryan\nand Rand, 1990). Males attract females to mate with a ‘whine’\ncall or a ‘whine-chuck’ call. When a male adds chucks to his\ncalls, he not only attracts more females, but also predators: frogeating bats that home in specifically on the chucks. Similarly, a\ncalling male field cricket attracts more females than does a silent\nmale, but he also attracts more parasitoid flies, and louder calls\nattract both more females and more parasitoid flies (Cade, 1975).\nIn some populations the rate of fly parasitism is so high that\nmales have lost the ability to sing (Zuk et al., 2006). As another\nexample, territorial animals often vocalize as a “keep-out” signal.\nWhen a territorial songbird is deprived of its voice, however,\npotential rivals show up and proceed to take over its territory\n(e.g., McDonald, 1989).\nIf we reframe our view of the communication system as\nbeginning with the implicit requirement that the receiver imposes\non the signaler—to signal—rather than with the signal itself, it\nis apparent that receivers can be conceived of as manipulating\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 9 March 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 602635\nBeecher Animal Communication and Simple Language\nsignalers, and in the ‘receiver manipulation’ view, the potential\ncosts to the sender are secondary to the potential benefits to\nthe receiver. A possible benefit for the female túngara frog –\nthe receiver in our example – might be a shorter search time in\nnavigating to the male who adds the more localizable chucks to\nhis calls, perhaps lessening her vulnerability to predation.\nThe receiver manipulation view prompts us to consider how\nthe receiver might demand a more honest signal. There are two\nrelated possibilities. First, the receiver can selectively attend to\nsignals that are inherently honest due to physical constraints. For\nexample, in many frogs and toads, size is the most important\nweapon in male battles over mating opportunities and size\nis reliably predicted by the pitch of the animal’s vocalization:\nlarger animals give lower-pitched calls. Davies and Halliday\n(1978) showed that playback of low-pitched calls was sufficient\nto discourage smaller males from entering into battle with\nan apparently larger male. A second way to require a more\nreliable signal has generally been discussed under the rubric\nof the ‘handicap’ principle. This principle was first proposed\nby Zahavi (1975), modified and formalized by Grafen (1990),\ngiven the intuitively pleasing graphical formulation by Johnstone\n(1997) shown in Figure 2, and is still being subjected to\nfurther modification and clarification (e.g., Penn and Számadó,\n2018). But the basic principle is straight-forward, and can be\nverbalized as follows: signals whose degree of expression is\ndependent on the health, general condition or vigor of the\nsignaler are inherently honest expressions of that individual’s\nquality. For a high-quality signaler, a ‘bigger’ signal is a smaller\nhandicap (less costly, or more affordable) than it is for a\nlow-quality signaler, thus ‘big’ signals are reliable signals of\nFIGURE 2 | Johnstone’s graphical model of the Handicap principle. The basic\nassumption is that it costs a high-quality signaler less to signal at its optimum\nlevel than it costs a low-quality signaler to signal at that level. The optimum or\nequilibrium level (where the difference between the costs and benefits of\nsignaling are greatest) for the low quality signaler is lower (opt low) than that\nfor the high-quality signaler (opt high). Thus the signaling level is a reliable\nindicator of signaler quality.\nsignaler quality. One of the clearest demonstrations of honesty\nin an epigamic signal was carried out by Petrie and her\ncolleagues on that poster animal for epigamic signaling, the\npeacock. Petrie and colleagues demonstrated that in their peacock\npopulation, females preferred a mate with more eyespots in his\nfeather train (whether the difference was natural, or produced\nby experimental manipulation), and that females mated with\nmales with more eyespots had more young surviving to a\nyear of age than females mated to males with fewer eyespots\n(Petrie et al., 1991; Petrie, 1994; Petrie and Halliday, 1994).\nAlthough the generality of these results has been questioned by\nstudies on other populations (Takahashi et al., 2008; Dakin and\nMontgomerie, 2011), the example provides a clear illustration\nof the predictions generated by the handicap principle, and how\nthey should be tested.\nThe handicap principle should maintain some degree of\nhonesty in any signaling system where signaler and receiver have\nnon-identical interests, such as virtually all mating and agonistic\ncontexts. A low-quality individual can only ‘lie’ by diverting\nenergy into signal development and expression that it needs for\nmaintenance, and so as Searcy and Nowicki (2005) succinctly put\nit, lying becomes more costly than signaling honestly. Searcy and\nNowicki suggest that ‘reliable’ is a better word here than ‘honest,’\nfor several reasons. First, as with reliability testing in science\nand elsewhere, we understand that although perfect reliability is\nunattainable, partial reliability may be good enough. In contrast,\n‘honesty’ is generally taken to mean absolute honesty. Second,\nreliability of a signal is empirically measurable. Thus instead\nof debating whether an animal signal is informative or not,\nwe can measure if it predicts something important about the\npresent state of affairs or future events. Thus for example, in\nan agonistic situation a ‘threat signal’ should predict subsequent\nescalation, and the strongest ‘threat’ signal should predict attack\n(Searcy and Beecher, 2009).\nSumming Up: Two Perspectives\nHistorically, the Information Transmission and Manipulation\nviews of animal communication systems have been presented\nas in opposition. I suggest that in fact they are simply different\nperspectives on the same process. Once we give the receiver\nagency, and accept that manipulation is a two-way or reciprocal\nprocess in animal communication, we see that the two views have\nmore in common than was at first thought. This rapprochement\nis nicely captured in the evolution of Dawkins and Krebs’s papers\non the topic. In their original paper, Dawkins and Krebs (1978)\nfocused on signalers and argued that “natural selection favors\n[signalers] who successfully manipulate [receivers] whether or\nnot this is to the advantage of the manipulated individuals.”\nHowever, 6 years later in a follow-up paper (Krebs and Dawkins,\n1984) they expanded their view to include receiver interests,\nnoting that receivers would be favored to resist manipulation\nand to attempt to “read the minds” of signalers. Finally, Krebs\n(1991), discussing Zahavi’s handicap principle, concluded that\nthe manipulation and honest signaling views are probably\nnot incompatible: “Dawkins and Krebs (1978) discussed a\ncoevolutionary process without specifying an end point, whereas\nZahavi was concerned mainly with the end-point itself, so it is\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 10 March 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 602635\nBeecher Animal Communication and Simple Language\npossible to imagine an evolutionary arms race of manipulation\nand sales resistance which end up with honest signaling”\n(Krebs, 1991, p. 67).\nFigure 3 is a schematic representation of what I will call the\nReciprocal Manipulation view. It shows communication taking\nplace on a battleground in which signaler and receiver are each\nselected to manipulate the other, the battle being settled in the\nlong run with the compromise of mostly-honest (reliable) signals.\nThe “management-assessment” theory of Owings and Morton\n(1997, 1998) is quite similar to the Reciprocal Manipulation\nview. Their theory captures the dynamics of signalers attempting\nto manage receivers and receivers assessing signalers. In their\nwords “the process of assessment is more active than has been\ngenerally recognized, and is responsible for the ‘informational’\ncouplings between individuals” (1997, p. 359). However, receivers\ndo more than just assess signalers, they manipulate them as\nwell, requiring them to signal in the first place, and requiring\na relatively honest signal as a prerequisite for responding to\nthe signal. The Reliable Signaling view of Searcy and Nowicki\n(2005) is essentially identical to the Reciprocal Manipulation\nview, with the superficial difference that the former focuses on\nthe information transmission aspect (reliable signaling) while\nthe latter focuses on the manipulation aspect (the conflicting\nmotivations of signaler and receiver).\nThe Reciprocal Manipulation and Information Transmission\nviews each seem most helpful in different circumstances\n(Table 3). Where the interests and thus motivations of the two\nparties differ, the Reciprocal Manipulation highlights the clash.\nIn contrast, where the interests and motivations of the two\nparties are more in line, the Information Transmission viewpoint\nfocuses on the essence of the interaction. Indeed, where the\noverlap of sender and receiver interests is considerable, as\nfor example between related individuals, or mates caring for\noffspring, or individuals in a social group where individuals are\nFIGURE 3 | Schematic suggesting the opposing pressures favoring signaler\nover receiver or vice-versa. Where interests of signaler and receiver are\ncoincident or nearly so (light gray to white) reliable communication will occur.\nAt the extremes of the space (darker), where interests of one or the other of\nthe two parties predominates, signaling will be disfavored. In the intermediate\n(gray) region, one party may benefit more than the other, but signaling may still\nbe ‘reliable enough.’\nstrongly interdependent, reliable, mutually beneficial signals will\nbe favored. But even where the interests of sender and receiver\nare partially opposed, selection acting on both parties will move\nthem to the region where both parties benefit on average, and\nsignals will still be reliable, if less so. This game theory dynamic\nhas been clearly laid out elsewhere (Maynard Smith and Harper,\n2003; Godfrey-Smith, 2013).\nI believe that the clash between these views of animal\ncommunication has ultimately led us to a clearer view of\nanimal communication systems than the original humanoriented information transmission view. Most animal\ncommunication systems are somewhere on the continuum\nfrom pure manipulation to pure communication, from arms race\n(where sender and receiver have different interests, each selected\nto behave so as to benefit themselves) to pure information\ntransmission (where sender and receiver have identical interests,\nand where signals benefit or cost both parties in the same way or\nto the same degree). A fuller development of these ideas can be\nfound in Beecher (2020).\nIn conclusion, I have argued that we should expect that natural\ncommunication systems will generally be reliable, even if not\nperfectly honest, with signaler and receiver both benefiting on\naverage. However, returning to the main theme of this paper,\nthere is no reason to expect such systems to blossom into\nsimple languages unless signalers and receivers have identical\nor near-identical interests, and if the ecological selective context\nrequires strong cooperation. There are cognitive prerequisites\nas well – otherwise one might predict that honeybees should\nhave a simple language – but the brake on the evolution to\nlanguage-like signaling systems in species with the requisite\ncognitive capacity is provided by the generally divergent\ninterests of signaler and receiver. Otherwise, bonobos, dolphins\nand some other vertebrates who seem to have the necessary\ncognitive prerequisites would have a more language-like natural\ncommunication systems than they do.\nWHY ARE THERE NO NATURAL\nLANGUAGE SYSTEMS IN ANIMALS?\nResearch on teaching animals simple human language indicate\nthat at least some animals appear to have the cognitive capacity to\ndecode language or language-like expressions. Herman’s dolphins\ncould comprehend a sign language command such as “take\nthe ball to the hoop” and to distinguish it from a similar but\nsyntactically different command like “take the hoop to the ball”\n(Herman, 2010). Kanzi the bonobo could respond correctly\nto novel verbal commands such as “Can you put the pine\nneedles in the refrigerator?” (Savage-Rumbaugh et al., 1993).\nPepperberg (1981, 1987) and Pailian et al. (2020) have shown\nthat African gray parrots can follow verbal directions to solve\ndifficult problems, including some that challenge humans. Yet\ndespite having the apparent capacities, at least to some extent,\nno non-human animal uses even a rudimentary language in its\nday-to-day existence. This includes groups like the songbirds that\nseem to have a crucial design feature, the learning and cultural\ntransmission of a complex set of vocal signals.

Differing motivations of sender and receiver Information transmitted from sender to receiver\nappear to be smart enough, or capable enough to handle a simple\nlanguage, but we have yet to discover an animal communication\nsystem – in nature – that rises to this level. Thus it appears that\nsome missing element other than cognitive or motor limitations\nhas blocked language evolution in non-human animals. Although\nit is possible that yet some other cognitive limitation has not\nbeen clearly identified (Hauser et al., 2002; Pinker and Jackendoff,\n2005), I focus in this final section on a candidate for the missing\nelement that is not purely a cognitive mechanism.\nA clue as to the missing element comes from the honeybee\n‘dance language.’ Despite a relatively simple nervous system,\nhoneybees are able not only to transmit precise information\nabout events in the external world, but also to use this system\nin two very different contexts (when talking about the location of\ndesirable food sources or about the location of suitable hive sites).\nThe key ingredient for the evolution of this system, I would argue,\nis zero conflict of interest between sender and receiver. Both scout\nand recruit are sister sterile workers and they are both working\nto feed sisters and brothers slated to be future reproductives.\nHumans also evolved in a social system featuring extraordinary\nlevels of cooperation, but significantly this cooperation was not\nrestricted to close relatives, as it is in the honeybees and other\nsocial insects, ruling out kin selection as a sufficient explanation\n(but see Fitch, 2004).\nI will reframe the question from “why not them?” to the\nquestion of “why us” (phrasing suggested by Hrdy, 2009)?\nHow did the human animal become the one species to evolve\nlanguage? As I argued in the previous section, the field has\narrived at a consensus concerning the factors that shape animal\ncommunication systems: the pressure for sender and receiver\neach to shape the interaction to its benefit inevitably both\nstimulates and constrains the evolution of the communication\nsystem. Very unusual circumstances are required for a true\nlanguage system to evolve. Three essential conditions have to\nbe met. First, the species must have the underlying cognitive\ncapacity. Honeybees may lack this, but some other animals may\nhave it. Second, and this is the clue provided by honeybees, sender\nand receiver must have identical or near identical interests. Third,\nindividuals must have a compelling need to transmit information\nacross multiple contexts. These are precisely the conditions that\nexisted in pre-human and early human hunter-gatherer societies,\nthe context in which humans and our hominid precursors spent\nsome 95% of our evolutionary history. The description of the\nprototypical hunter-gatherer society that follows is based on\ninformation from a number of sources (including Boehm, 1999;\nBowles, 2006; Hrdy, 2009; Hill K. et al., 2011; Knight and Power,\n2011; Lee, 2018).\nOur hunter-gather ancestors lived in small social groups\nwhere individuals were strongly interdependent, and cooperation\nacross multiple contexts was essential for survival. Most highly\ncooperative animal societies such as the eusocial insects are\ntypically just very large families, but the human hunter-gatherer\nsocieties we know – and which we assume to be typical of\nthe ancestral type – consisted of members of several kin lines.\nThus human societies then – and now as well – required\nextensive cooperation among unrelated individuals. Humans are\nthe supreme cooperators in the animal world, but because this\ncooperation is not supported by high kin relatedness, it has\nto withstand a strong undercurrent of individual competition.\nWe sometimes lose sight of the human affinity for withingroup cooperation because of its paradoxical coexistence with\nintense between-group competition and tribalism. Irreconcilable\nconflicts within ancestral hunter-gatherer groups surely occurred,\nbut were often resolved by individuals leaving one group for\nanother (hunter-gatherer societies being classic examples of\nfission-fusion societies).\nStudents of human evolution, while differing as to what were\nthe key selective contexts, or the key adaptations, all agree that\nhuman evolution has been characterized by remarkable levels\nof within-group cooperation among unrelated individuals, on\na scale not seen in any non-human animal. Several contexts\nstand out as crucial for the high level of cooperation found\nin hunter-gather societies. They begin, of course, with hunting\nand gathering. Effective group hunting (usually done by men)\nrequires sharing of information about distant prey and discussion\nof strategies for capturing prey. In essentially the same way,\ngathering of plants and fruits (usually done by women) requires\nthe ability to track the growing schedules and locations of many\nplants and fruits in the area and the ability to discuss and\ncoordinate foraging activities efficiently. Furthermore, huntergatherer societies periodically have to pick up and move to a\nnew, more abundant locale. These moves require discussion and\ngroup consensus, with input from all parties, especially older,\nmore experienced men and women.\nA second, equally important axis of cooperation is childraising. Humans are unique among primates in the time and\ncost required to raise an offspring. Humans solved this problem\nby involving the whole group in the process. Hrdy (2009) has\npointed out that this pattern of cooperative breeding sets humans\napart from the exclusive mother-centered parenting of our closest\nrelatives, the great apes. In these early human societies, many\nindividuals played a role in the cooperative care. For starters, the\nwhole group participated in that food brought back to the camp\nwas typically shared among all individuals, without reference\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 12 March 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 602635\nBeecher Animal Communication and Simple Language\nto their role in procuring the food. Then unlike most mammals,\nthe father participated in child care alongside the mother. Other\nrelatives were routinely involved in direct child care, especially\nolder siblings and grandparents, often aunts and uncles too, and\nsometimes non-relatives as well.\nFinally, within-group cooperation is essential for success in\nbetween-group competition, warfare in particular. This aspect of\nour hunter-gather heritage is strongly debated in anthropology.\nUsing the terms of Lee (2018), the Peaceful school views\nsignificant inter-group competition as not beginning until the\nAgricultural era, when property gave humans something to fight\nover. The Bellicose school (e.g., Kelly, 2000; Gat, 2015) believes\ninter-group competition dates further back in our evolutionary\npast. But whenever it started, warfare would certainly promote\nadaptations for within-group cooperation.\nIn recent years various investigators have proposed key\nadaptations that may have allowed human societies to achieve\nthis high level of cooperation in the absence of the glue of a very\nhigh level of kinship. Although there is not complete agreement\nas to which of these adaptations were most crucial, taken together\nthey coalesce into a suite of psychological adaptations that\npromote prosocial within-group interactions within a context\nof near-complete interdependence. Indeed, Tomasello et al.\n(2012) have dubbed this the Interdependence hypothesis. The\nspecific adaptations include: shared intentionality (Tomasello\net al., 2005), egalitarianism (Boehm, 1999), social learning\nand communication (Herrmann et al., 2007), intersubjectivity\nand empathy (Hrdy, 2009), moral intuitions (Haidt, 2012),\nadaptations for teaching and receiving teaching, and thus cultural\ntransmission (Sterelny, 2012; Henrich, 2016; Whiten, 2017),\nproactive aggression (Wrangham, 2018) and self-domestication\n(Wrangham, 2019). These adaptations of our social mind appear\nto be what set us apart from the other great apes, who it\nhas been argued are otherwise just as cognitively advanced\n(Herrmann et al., 2007). This suite of adaptations has enabled\nus to live in complex, cooperative societies. Despite our equally\nextraordinary proactive (deliberate and planned) aggressive\ntendencies, directed typically at out-groups, as in wars, pogroms,\ncrusades and the like (Wrangham, 2018), no other social animal\nhas achieved the level of within-group docility and cooperation\nwithout high within-group relatedness that is found in the human\nspecies. I note that Knight (2018) has an advanced an argument\nsimilar to the one I have presented here.\nLanguage unquestionably represents the pinnacle of evolved\nanimal communication systems, and as noted at the beginning\nof this section, attempts to teach language to animals have\nnot significantly changed this view. Language is often given\npride of place in human evolution. In this view the other\nadaptations mentioned above came only after some form of\nlanguage was in place. I favor the view of Hrdy (2009), that this\nmay well reverse cause and effect. The evolution of language\nmay have only become possible when the posited unique suite of\nprosocial, communicative and mind-reading adaptations were in\nplace. The crucial importance of communication in the strongly\ninterdependent social system of early humans would have created\nthis prosocial suite of adaptations, and would have laid the\ngroundwork for evolving a true language.\nAUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS\nThe author confirms being the sole contributor of this work and\nhas approved it for publication.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nMany thanks to editor IP, three reviewers, John Byers, Doug\nMock, Trish Schwagmeyer, and Bill Searcy for their very\nthoughtful reviews of the manuscript.\nREFERENCES\nAkçay, Ç, Anderson, R.

Heinrich and J.M. Marzluff\nDepartment of Zoology, University of Vermont, Burlington, VT 05405, USA\nReceived January 24, 1990 / Accepted July 28, 1990\nSummary. The formation of groups at food bonanzas\nresults from a variety of mechanism, which include recruitment by signalling and information parasitism. Recruitment is distinguished from information parasitism\non functional grounds: attraction of a crowd is termed\nrecruitment if the signaler's fitness is enhanced by the\nattraction of others but termed parasitism if the signaler's fitness is reduced by the attraction of others. We\nhere show, however, that in Common Ravens, Corvus\ncorax, the proximate reasons for giving recruitment signals are probably other than for attracting a crowd. In\nthe forests of the northeastern United States, non-breeding, vagrant ravens commonly aggregate in large\nnumbers at carcasses where they neutralize the defense\nof territorial adults. We attempted to mimic this situation with a captive flock of juveniles and a pair of resident adults in order to determine the proximate factors\ntriggering \"yells\", vocalizations which attract nearby ravens to large animal carcasses. Our experiments indicate\nthat yells are given primarily by hungry birds. However,\nyelling is strongly modified by status. Within the vagrant\ncrowd, status is labile. When successive dominants were\nremoved, replacements immediately took their place.\nFurthermore, when the dominants were re-introduced\nto the flock they always suffered significant losses of\nstatus and ceased yelling. The territorial male has, and\nconstantly maintains, the highest status within (but not\nnecessarily outside) his territory, and here he rarely yells.\nIn sharp contrast, within the vagrant crowd of unmated\nbirds it is the highest-status birds that are the most likely\nto yell when approaching food. Furthermore, the dominant vagrants (as well as adults) suppress yelling in subordinates. We conclude that ravens yell proximately to\nadvertise their status at food, and that recruitment is\nonly one of several ultimate advantages of the behavior.\nIntroduction\nMany species of animals aggregate in large numbers at\nlocalized food bonanzas. Groups can be assembled by\nOffprint request to .' B. Heinrich\na wide varietiy of mechanisms. For example, on the\nplains of Africa thousands of beetles are attracted to\na single dung pile where they compete intensely (Heinrich and Bartholomew 1978). They are presumably attracted by the smell of the dung itself. Vultures are attracted to carcasses by seeing others spiralling down to\nthem (K6nig 1983). A food bonanza may also be discovered by a group, that then feeds as a group (Balda\nand Bateman 1971). In addition, and perhaps most interestingly, animals may be attracted by signals given by\nthose discovering food. Specific attraction signals include the \"chirrup\" calls of House sparrows (Elgar\n1986), the \"whinny\" calls of spider monkeys (Chapman\nand Lefebvre 1990), the undulating flights of ospreys\n(Greene 1987), and the \"yells\" of ravens (Heinrich 1988,\n1989). Sometimes unsuccessful foragers also follow successful ones using subtle and largely unknown cues\n(Ward and Zhahavi 1973; Rabenold 1987 a; Krebs 1974;\nBrown 1986). In the latter cases information may be\nwithheld, and/or following may be suppressed (Waltz\n1983; Rabenold 1987b).\nWhether or not recruitment or information parasitism occurs is often a controversial topic, because to\nmany it raises the question of whether the signallers try\nto call in others or whether instead they are being exploited. But part of the controversy is artificial because\nthe distinction between proximate and ultimate causes\nof attraction signals have commonly not been made.\nMuch confusion has arisen because it is generally assumed that the two coincide. In other words, it is usually\nassumed that when animals recruit they give signals\n\"to\" attract others. Likewise, if information is parasitized it is usually assumed that the signals are not given\n\"to\" attract others. It is not necessary to impart volition\nto animals giving recruitment signals and then use this\nas the basis for distinguishing recruitment from parasitism. Attraction of a crowd can yield a great variety of\ndifferent costs and benefits. But the balance must be\npositive for attraction signals to evolve. Recruitment is\ndistinguished from parasitism on this purely functional\nground by investigating the ultimate consequences of\ngroup formation. Recruitment results when assembled\ngroups increase the signaler's fitness. Parasitism results\nwhen assembled groups decrease the signaler's fitness. \n14\nBy removing volition from the equation of whether\nor not recruitment occurs, we are faced with a second\nquestion: What is/are the proximate reason(s) for giving\nsignal(s) that result in recruitment (or parasitism)? Presumably any of a number of signals originally used and\nperhaps still functional for other purposes can be used\nand even modified to function as recruitment signals.\nTherefore, the proximate reason a recruitment signal is\ngiven is not necessarily to attract others. Recruitment\nsignals evolve because they enhance fitness and it is not\nnecessary for a signaler to realize this function. Only\nwhen the proximate reasons for giving recruitment signals include the attraction of others is the signaler behaving in an apparently purposeful manner that previous\nworkers implied was necessary for one to use the term\n\"recruitment.\" Costa Rican spider monkeys provide a\npossible example of recruitment where proximate and\nultimate reasons for signaling coincide. These monkeys\nadjust their group size to match resource availability\nby uttering \"whinny\" calls when groups are small relative to resource abundance and by withholding calls\nwhen enlarged group size results in heightened competition (Chapman and Lefebvre 1990). In the above and\nmany other cases of documented recruitment, scenarios\nof kin selection or reciprocity could explain the attraction of others, where the animals may proximately\n\"want\" to recruit. However, as discussed elsewhere\n(Heinrich 1988, 1989), this ultimate adaptive advantage\nis unlikely for ravens because of their vagrancy.\nHere we report on an experimental study designed\nto decipher the proximate factors eliciting the \"yell\"\nvocalization of Common Ravens (Corvus corax). This\nvocalization is given by immature vagrants near food\nwhich attracts other nearby vagrants (Heinrich 1988).\nElsewhere we investigated the ultimate function of group\nformation and concluded that it increases the signaler's\nfitness because crowds are able to overpower territorial\nadults and access defended foods unavailable to single\nravens (Heinrich 1988, 1989; Marzluff and Heinrich in\nprep.). Given our functional definitions, group formation by attraction to yells therefore constitutes recruitment, not parasitism. The results reported herein allow\nus to determine the motivation of the signaler thereby\ngaining a broader understanding of recruitment in this\nspecies.\nMethods\nApparatus and subjects. On 29 and 31 December 1988 we captured\n20 immature ravens (6 yearlings and 14 juveniles) and placed them\nin the main aviary of our aviary complex (Fig. 1). These immatures\nwere part of a group of approximately 50 ravens that were foraging\nat a dead cow in the mountains of western Maine within 20 meters\nof the aviary. Birds were captured in a walk-in trap, aged by mouth\nand plumage coloration, and marked with uniquely numbered and\ncolored patagial tags on both wings (see Heinrich, 1988 for details\nof the study area and capture and marking techniques). Laparotomies on December 8, 1989, indicated a sex ratio of 6 c?/14%\nImmatures quickly adapted to their new surroundings. They\nroosted as a communal group in a covered shed, fed as a group\nat liberally supplied carcasses and slaughter house offal (birds were\nf R'OO~T ~ ~\nAWAB¥ )\n, x ~xi x\"\nga\n/ OBBERVATION HUT :=: ;..\\\n?-k\n[ ) TERRITORIAL\n~ ADULTS\nFig. 1.

The entire complex is interconnected and arms\ncan be opened or shut off by raising or lowering gates with guy\nwires operated from inside the observation hut. Due to terrain\n(hut is at the apex of a knoll) and vegetation (a spruce thicket\nlies between 2 peripheral aviaries) birds in the peripheral aviaries\ncan only see the lower quarter of the main aviary and vice versa.\nX's mark locations of food during experiments. The aviary complex\nis from 4-7 m in height and contains 50 vertical perches and 26\nhorizontal ones scattered throughout\nnever without food for more than 3 days during the first 3 months),\nbathed in the snow, allopreened and fought. Qualitatively, their\nbehavior was identical to the behavior of free-living immatures\nwe continued to monitor.\nOn 2 January we captured 3 adults and placed them in one\nof the peripheral aviaries of the complex (Fig. 1). 2 of these adults\nallopreened regularly, called in synchrony, and mirrored each\nother's actions suggesting to us (and another experienced with ravens, E. Gwinner) that they were an established pair. The third\nbird was released after 2 days of ostracism by the \"pair\". The\npair was fed ad libitum in their aviary and quickly began to defend\nits boundaries from free-living wild birds and from juveniles wandering in the arm between the main aviary and the adult aviary.\nThe adults asserted their dominant status by giving bowing ceremonies, thick-head postures, and ear-tuft intimidation displays (Gwinher 1964; Heinrich 1988) to any intruders.\nWe allowed our captive immatures to find food bonanzas\n(hunks of meat and carcasses ranging in size from squirrels to\ndeer) randomly located throughout the aviary complex for 3\nmonths prior to the experiment we discuss here. During this time\nwe determined dominance-subordination relationships by ad libirum observations of dyads during foraging (Altman 1974). The\ndominant of an interaction was the bird that forced the other to\nback away from confrontation in the fuzzy-headed submission posture (Heinrich 1988).\nA stable dominance hierarchy quickly developed among our\ncaptive immatures. It was clear from the first few days of captivity\nthat a few immatures consistently dominated all the other birds.\nOver a 3 month period (30 December-16 March) a hierarchy developed which we have broken into 4 categories: 1) 3 dominants who\nrarely deferred to others, 2) 6 subdominants who deferred to a\nminority of birds primarily dominants and other subdominants,\n3) 5 intermediates who won roughly 40% of their encounters, and\n4) 6 subordinates who rarely defeated any other bird. There was\nan obvious alpha male (RB) who only lost 2 encounters (both\nto the beta male) and had uncontested access to food at any time.\nOur method of determining the dominance hierarchy minimizes\nthe number of times individuals lose to lower ranking birds (Appleby 1983), however some nonlinearity was evident as one subordinate consistently defeated an intermediate and a lower ranking \n15\n0 40'\nZ\n~ 35- Z ..j\n~ ~ ~o.\n~ ~ 25- .J\n20.\n>-~m ~5\"\nL~ IL\n0 0 10-\nn,- n\"\nuJ uJ 5-\n~ rn\n:~ ~ 0-\n~ ~)\nz Z\nmmYELLS\n~;3 YELLERS\nZERO TWO FOUR\nDAYS WITHOUT FOOD\nFig. 2.

Means are derived from the total response\nof the group to each of 5 food locations during each of 8 group\ncompositions (N=40 for 2 and 4 days without food, N=39 for\nzero days without food because of one missing observation)\nsubdominant defeated a higher ranking one. Despite the circular\ntriads created by these reversals, Appleby's (I 983) method indicates\nthat this hierarchy was significantly linear (linearity coefficient,\nK=0.93, X2 = 157, df= 27, P<0.001).\nExperimentalprotocol. From 23 March until 6 July 1989 we systematically varied composition of the immature group, the location\nof food, and the hunger level of immatures in order to determine\nhow these three factors influenced yelling. Two observers watched\nbirds thyough two-way mirrors with 10-power binoculars from an\nobservation hut 10 meters from the main aviary (Fig. 2). We recorded the identity of yellers and their rate of yelling (number\nof yells in randomly selected i rain intervals), who initially approached and contacted food, how long before food was contacted\nand consumed, and whether food was defended. Vocalizations were\nrecorded on a Sony TCM-5000 cassette recorder using a Senheiser\nME-88 microphone.\nWe could not accurately count yelling rates for all birds in\nan experiment. However, we could easily and unambiguously assign birds to primary or secondary yelling status. In an experiment\nthere were usually 1 or 2 primary yellers who yelled nearly constantly and maintained consistently high rates of yelling throughout\na majority of phases (different locations of food) of the experiment.\nPrimary yellers accounted for a majority of the yells uttered. However, in most experiments 3-10 secondary yellers yelled 1 or a\nfew times.\nWe employed a hierarchical experimental design to test the\ninfluence of the 3 factors. Group composition was the main blocking factor and consisted of 4 independent levels. Hunger was a\nthree-level repeated measure nested within each group. Location\nwas a five-level repeated measure within each hunger level. Each\ngroup was replicated twice resulting in 8 experiments. Each experiment consisted of 3 runs on 3 separate days (one for each hunger\nlevel) and on each day responses were measured in 5 phases (one\nfor each food location). One phase was omitted from analysis\n(\" Split Group\" when birds were satiated and the alpha was removed) because birds could not be segregated in the aviary arm.\nGroup composition was modified by removing dominant birds\nfrom the immature group. The first group composition included\nall birds. Our first manipulation was to remove the alpha male\nand his consort. After 7-10 days of allowing the remaining immatures to establish a dominance hierarchy (all birds simply shifted\nup one position) we tested this new group and then removed its\nalpha male. Again 1 week was allowed for reshuffling (all shifted\none position), birds were retested, and the alpha male removed.\nThus by removing three alpha males in succession we created 4\ngroup compositions. The response of birds in each composition\nwas replicated after a 14 day ad libitum feeding period by reintroducing each male in the reverse order from the order of removal.\nHunger level was repeated within each replicate of group composition. We modified hunger level by removing all food from\nsatiated birds for varying lengths of time. Responses of satiated\nbirds in each group were measured after they had fed ad libitum\nfor 2-6 days and still had food left on the day of the test. This\nresponse was contrasted to the response of birds on the second\nand fourth day without food. The order of application of hunger\nlevel to groups was randomized. In order to reduce accumulation\nof carryover effects between hunger treatments on different groups\nwe repeatedly satiated the birds during the 7-10 day period of\nreshuffling after an alpha male was removed.\nFood (5-15 kg hunks of meat) location was a second repeated\nmeasure because the immatures were exposed to each food location\non every day of the experiment. Each day we measured the calling\nresponse of immatures under 5 conditions. 1) Baseline = Before we\nplaced food in the aviary. 2) Group Approach = As immatures approached freely accessible food in the main aviary or just inside\nthe arm leading to the adult aviary. 3) Behind Screen=As they\napproached inaccessible food behind a lowered screen door separating the main aviary from the arm. 4) With Adults=As they\napproached inaccessible food in the adults' aviary behind a lowered\nscreen door. 5) Split Group=We captured approximately half of\nthe immatures in the arm of the complex by closing the screen\ndoor as the group began to enter. The rest of the group remained\nin the main aviary. Our intent was to separate the alpha male\nfrom the beta male. Food was placed in the main aviary or in\nthe arm so that ~[ group could get to it but the other group could\nonly see the food. After the group with access approached and\nbegan to eat, the meat was removed and placed with the other\ngroup until they approached and began to eat. Behaviors of all\nbirds as either group approached constituted the response for this\ntreatment.\nAdditional observations, as indicated, were made on birds in\nthe wild in the study area near the aviary, and on hand-reared\nbirds.\nResults\nOverall ANO VA\nHunger and location of food significantly influenced\nyelling rate and the number of birds yelling (Table 1).\nImmatures yelled more frequently as their level of\nhunger increased (Fig. 2). Satiated birds rarely yelled.\nOnly 50% of experiments with satiated birds produced\nany yelling. In contrast, after 4 days without food all\nexperiments had yellers, over a third of the group yelled,\nand many of the birds yelled continuously. The rate of\nyelling increased 16-fold every 2 days immatures were\nwithout food. As soon as foraging began, even after\n4 days without food, yelling subsided and was typically\nextinguished 10 min after the onset of eating. The major\ninfluence of food location on yelling was a decline in\nthe number of yellers and their rate of yelling when food\nwas located in the adults' aviary (Fig. 3). This food was\napproximately 0.5 m from the screen partition and when\nimmatures approached it the adults flew up to meet them\nwith ear-tuft intimidation displays and harsh calls that\nare often given by free-living adults when we trespass\nin their territories and when they fly over our captive\nadults. Yelling was most frequent when some or all birds\nhad access to the food and adults were out of view (Split\nApproach and Group Approach). However, inaccessible \n16\nT~ble 1.

As hunger increased, yelling\nincreased, in all locations. However, the relative reduction in yelling when food was placed with adults became\nmore noticable as hunger increased (Fig. 3). After 4 days\nwithout food, yelling was even triggered by the sight\nof the observers entering the observation hut without\nplacing food in the aviary. (We suspect the birds were\nyelling in response to the expectation of food, inasmuch\nas fledged young yell when they see their parents approach.)\nGroup composition was not significantly related to\nyelling (Table 1, Fig. 4).

Change in yelling and changing composition of yellers (with\nrespect to dominance) as a function of hunger. The percentage\nof all birds in a given class that yelled or were silent at 3 hunger\nlevels are shown. Percentages of yellers in each status class were\ndetermined by summing the number of yellers per dominance class\nacross the 8 tests of group composition and dividing this sum\nby the total birds in each class summed across the 8 experiments.\nChanges in status through the course of experimentation were accounted for which resulted in a total of 144 subordinates, 120\nintermediates, 114 subdominants, and 66 dominants across the 8\nexperiments. Filled bars primary yeller; hatched bars secondary\nyeller; open bars did not yell in experiment\nDuring experiments with satiated birds there were few\nprimary yellers and these were usually low ranking birds\nand never dominants (Fig. 5 A). The few dominants that\ndid yell did so only occasionally. As hunger increased\nnearly all dominants yelled and after four days without\nfood most primary yellers were high ranking birds\n(Fig. 5 B, C).\nDominant immatures suppress yelling by subordinates\nDuring the first replicate of the group composition manipulations subordinates yelled more frequently as dominants were removed (Fig. 6). When the alpha was removed, 4 new birds yelled for the first time including\nthe new dominant who did not yell in experiment 1 and\n2 intermediates who, after the alpha's removal, had risen\nin status. After removing the beta in addition to the\nalpha, 6 additional birds yelled for the first time. These\nwere primarily subordinates. Lastly, after the gamma\nwas removed still 1 more subordinate yelled. In total,\n19 of 20 birds yelled, but over half of these did not\nyell until 1 or more of their superiors were removed\nfrom the group. One subordinate never yelled.\nIt appears that alpha birds actively suppress the yelling of other dominants. A dramatic example of suppression occurred in experiment 2. The birds headed down\nthe arm toward the adults' aviary and the beta male\nyelled 8 times during the first minute. The alpha, who\nhad been silent, then attacked the beta, pinned him to\nthe snow and jabbed him with his bill. For the remainder\nof the experiment the beta was silent and the alpha yelled\nan average of 18.4 times/rain. More typically, suppression by the alpha was not physically forced upon other\ndominants and was only obvious when the dominants\nwere separated as we did in our Split Group treatment.\n17\n--~ 20 m~\n-~-\n01'- 15-\nD\n~_~\n,oil.\no\n.-~\nZ\nDOMINANTS ~\nSUBDOMINANTS ~ -\nINTERMEDIATES ~\nALL ALPHA ALPHA& ALPHA,\nPRESENT REMOVED BETA BETA &\nREMOVED GAMMA\nREMOVED\nGROUP COMPOSITION\n-2O\nO\nOc\n.15 mc\n• 10 ~ -<\nNz\nC g ~-K\nrrl\n0\nFig. 6.

The line graph gives the cumulative number of birds that\nhad yelled at some point during experimentation. The bar graph\nindicates the composition of the new yellers accumulated in the\nline graph each time an alpha was removed. (Status categories\nrefer to status prior to the experiment)\nDuring this phase of experiment 1 we succeeded in getting the alpha and beta on opposite sides of the screen\ndoor. Although these birds were in visual and vocal contact within a few meters of each other the beta's behavior\nimmediately shifted when he was protected from the alpha and assumed the top position within his subgroup.\nInstead of waiting for the alpha to lead the way to food,\nthe beta was the first to eat and he yelled and attacked\nothers as he approached the food (Fig. 7A). However,\nhe never yelled when in the same subgroup with the\nalpha.\nIn experiment 2, the alpha was removed leaving the\nbeta in charge and he yelled regardless of who was in\nhis presence (Fig. 7 B). We were not able to isolate the\ngamma in this experiment and he remained silent in the\npresence of the beta. We did succeed in isolating the\ndelta and he took charge of his subgroup and yelled\nonly when isolated from the beta and gamma.\nIn experiment 3, the alpha and beta were removed\nand the gamma finally yelled as he assumed the alpha\nrole in the group (Fig. 7 C). As in experiment 2, the delta\nyelled only when isolated from the gamma. The delta\ncontinued yelling after the alpha, beta, and gamma were\nremoved (Fig. 7D). In this last experiment, however, the\ndelta and epsilon both yelled and even yelled without\nconflict when perched side by side.\nIn the first 3 experiments we can make 6 independent\ncomparisons of yelling by dominants when in the alpha's\ngroup versus when not in his group. 3 of these are comparisons of yelling within an experiment when dominants never yelled unless they were out of the alpha's\ngroup (then they averaged 8 yells/rain, SD = 5). Yelling\nby dominants in the experiments following removal of\nthe current alpha versus yelling in the previous experiment with the alpha provide three more comparisons.\nDominants did not yell with the alpha, but averaged \n18\nLu\nz\n30-\n25\"\n20\"\n15\"\n10\"\n5\"\n0\n'!t 1\nR\n0 ~\nm ALL BIRDS IN CONTACT 100 ]\n~2~ SCREEN BETWEEN /\nDOMINANT and 801 SUBDOMINANT ~D m i R B, O REMOVED 60[ All Birds Present ~ I-\n(Expo 1) A uJZ ~\no8 40\nn.,,\nul 20 n\n0\nil °\nAlpha Removed\n(Exp. 2)\n11 B\n8\n10-Alpha and Beta\nRemoved\n5-\n0\n10-\n52\n0\n(Exp.3)R R ~\nAlpha, Beta and\nGamma Removed\n5) ~Exp.

Only approaches to food by hungry birds (3-4 days without\nfood) are included. Samples are derived from N= 13 approaches\nbefore removal and N=46 after reintroduction. Note apparent\nloss of both status (defense) and \"bravery\" (willingness to approach first)\nremoved (Table 1, Fig. 4). In the first replicate of group\ncomposition the percentage of immatures yelling increased from 40% when all birds were present, to 50%\nafter the alpha was removed, to 88% after the beta was\nremoved, and it remained at 88% after the gamma was\nremoved. However, when the dominant birds were reintroduced the percentage of the group yelling remained\nhigh varying only between 75% and 83%, rather than\nreturning to previous levels.\nThe continued yelling of many birds after the dominants were reintroduced was likely due to status shifts.\nThe moment we placed previous dominants back into\nthe main aviary they were chased and attacked by the\nnew alpha and beta birds. Evidently, the returnees were\nrecognized as intruders and not as formerly dominant\ngroup members (free-living vagrants that visit the aviary\nare also responded to with threatening postures). Returning dominants did not reclaim their prior status.\nEach dropped at least 3 places in the hierarchy (Table 2).\nTable 2. Changes in the status of top ranking birds after the alpha, beta, and gamma\nwere removed from the main aviary. Each dominant was the alpha bird just prior to\nhis removal and each dropped in status after reintroduction. All 3 dominants were housed\ntogether in a peripheral aviary during removal.

All 10 nestlings were observed\nyelling during the course of a test. Error bars are +/-1 SD\nEspecially surprising was the change in RB's status. As\nthe former alpha he was extremely dominant but upon\nreintroduction he was consistently displaced by 3 birds\nfor nearly 2 months.\nAssociated with drop in the former alpha birds' stares was a change in their foraging behavior and yelling.\nReintroduced former dominants rarely were the first to\napproach food and were even less frequently defensive\nof food they approached (Fig. 8). Neither of the 3 former\nalpha birds yelled during the experiment following reintroduction (Fig. 9). Only after 2 months did RB occasionally yell when he approached food. Reintroduced\nalphas did not regain the status and did not continue\nto behave tyrannically at food nor suppress others from\nyelling.\nOntogeny of yelling\nYelling in response to hunger develops early in life. We\nhand-reared 10 nestlings in the spring of 1989. On four\noccasions we allowed them to go through a series of\nhunger-feeding cycles (Fig. 10). Nestlings began to make\nyell-like calls (Fig. 11 A) after 2-3 h without food, however, within a few minutes of eating yelling was silenced.\nThe rate of yelling declined significantly as a function\nof time since feeding (Kruskal-Wallis W= 10.2 P=0.006)\nThe transition from hoarse begging calls to clear yells\noccurs over a 3 month period (Fig. 11 A).\nVariation in yelling\n2 sources of variation in yells were apparent. First, individuals produced yells differing in tone (Fig. 11 B). Second, yells given by dominants as they approached food\ndiffered from yells given in less aggressive situations\n(Fig. 1 l C).

C\nApproximately 30 birds feeding on a\ndeer and a bear on 8 Nov. D\nApproximately 50 birds feeding on a\ncow on 23 Nov. These 4 observations\nwere made 1 to 3 days after a large\ncrowd gathered at each bait. Time span\nof observations varies depending on\ndisturbance during arrival (Times from\narrival at feeding site to crowd eating:\nA=37 rain, B=2 h 20 min, C=1 h\n7 rain, D = 53 min)\nComparisons to free-living birds\nBehavior in the aviary closely matched that observed\nin nature. In the field, dominant ravens also were responsine for the marjority of yelling. 8 tagged birds were\nobserved yelling at carcasses. All yelled as they approached food, displaced another bird, and took over\na choice feeding spot. Yelling by wild ravens typically\npeaks as they begin to feed approximately 0.5-1 h after\nbirds arrive from their nocturnal roost (Fig. 12). During\npeak yelling, most yells are short, sharp \"who!\" yells\ngiven by birds claiming prime feeding spots. Prior to\nfeeding, most yells are long, loud and given by unidentified perched birds.\nThe status and behavior of our captive immatures\npersisted after they were reintroduced into the wild 1\nyear after their original capture. We observed 3 dominants, 4 subdominants, 2 intermediates, and 3 subordinates for a 2 week period after their release. These birds\nforaged at carcasses along with 10-30 wild vagrants and\na pair of resident adults. The dominants and subdominants deferred to few birds and held choice feeding positions. The intermediates and subordinates deferred to\nmost birds they encountered, fed infrequently, and rarely\ncontrolled foods.\nDiscussion\nIn the forests of northeastern North America, ravens\ngenerally forage for carcasses and other food (Bruggers\n1988) in the winter by flying singly or in pairs. However,\nlarge numbers of vagrant, nonbreeding birds are commonly found at food bonanzas. One of the vocalizations\ncommonly heard from vagrants at the aggregations in\nthe \"yell,\" and playbacks of this call are highly effective\nin attracting those ravens which are already aggregated\nin the surrounding forest (or passing through) near a\nfood bonanza (Heinrich 1985, 1988). Grouping is adaptive because it allows vagrants, who are subordinate to\nterritorial adults, to access and profitably forage on defended foods (Heinrich 1988 b, 1989; Marzluff and Heinrich in prep.).\nIn nature commonly only one or a few birds of any\nfeeding crowd yell before feeding begins (Heinrich 1989).\nWhich birds yell? Our field and aviary observations suggest that the first yellers of the morning are hungry birds\nthat experienced poor feeding on preceding days. These\nbirds give loud, drawn out yells while perched in trees\naround a carcass. When feeding begins yelling reaches\na peak as many birds descend to the ground and walk\nup to claim their feeding positions. Dominant juveniles\ngive the majority of yells and they walk with erect\nfeathers, spread their shoulders and take the prime feeding spots. Our experiments indicate that these dominant\nimmatures suppress the yelling of the closest subdominant immatures.\nProximate reasons for yelling\nAs we argued in the Introduction it is necessary to understand the proximate basis of recruitment signals, such\nas the yell. Our results suggest that hunger and status\nadvertisement are the primary proximate factors causing\nyelling. Overpowering territorial adults is not a proximate reason for yelling as yells were rarely given by\nimmatures in the presence of adults. In addition, if attraction of others was a proximate reason for yelling\nthen dominant vagrants would not be expected to inhibit\nsubordinates from calling. Instead, dominants should\npunish subordinates for not calling, as occurs in spider\nmonkeys (Chapman and Lefebvre 1990). We conclude\nthat the accumulation of ravens at the site of yelling\nrepresents recruitment because attraction of ravens by\nyelling enhances the fitness of the signaler, but assembling a crowd is not a proximate reason for yelling.\nThe ontogeny of yelling can be traced to the nestling\nstage. Sonograms of individual birds beginning while\nthey are still in the nest indicate a progression from\nrasping disharmonic calls to the loud harmonic yells typically heard at food (Fig. 11). Thus, initially the birds\nyell proximately in response to the presence of food (or\nthe expectation of food), provided they are hungry. The\nfollowing winter (and winters) they continue to do the\nsame, except now the yell is restrained by social superiors.\nAdaptive significance of yelling\nMost species of birds produce begging calls as nestlings\nwhen they are fed. However, these are lost shortly after\nindependence from parental care. We know of no other\ncases where begging calls develop into louder, more easily located calls indicative of food. Presumably this is\nrare because in most cases it is disadvantageous to \n21\nbroadcast the presence of food. On the contrary, it is\nadvantageous for vagrant ravens to advertise the location of food because most foods are defended and therefore unavailable until a crowd assembles and overpowers\nthe defending territory owners.\nYelling may be of further adaptive significance as\na status signal. As has previously been determined\n(Gwinner 1964), captive ravens kept within a flock form\nand maintain a linear dominance hierarchy, and social\ndominance in these birds is an important correlate of\npair formation. At least in part, the food bonanzas on\nwhich ravens specialize serve as a site where dominance\nis established, reinforced and/or maintained by fighting\nand by appropriate signalling of both dominance and\nsubmission. It therefore seems likely that the yelling we\nobserved in our captive birds is related to status signalling that might ultimately translate to mate and food\nacquisition.\nIf yelling by immatures ultimately functions in their\ngaining access to defended foods, it may at first appear\ncurious that they did not yell in the presence of the\nadults. Indeed the adults inhibited, rather than facilitated, yelling. However, the presence of defensive adults\nmay not trigger yelling because adults attack yelling vagrants, thus discouraging their display of status and reducing recruitment to the food the adults try to defend.\nHow can a signal that is proximally given as a show\nof hunger and status be ultimately functional also in\nrecruitment? The show of status ultimately functions in\nsexual selection (Gwinner 1964; Komers and Dhindsa\n1989). However, since the same display yields other advantages related to feeding and gaining access to food,\nit has likely become amplified rather than compromised\nthrough evolution. Presumably this is rare because in\nmost cases it is disadvantageous to broadcast the presence of food. However, it is convenient for ravens to\nadvertise status at food, and it is advantageous for vagrant ravens to advertise the location of food, because\nmost foods are defended and therefore unavailable until\na crowd assembles and overpowers the defending territory owners. As a result, even though yelling is stimulated\nby hunger and status it has likely been embellished by\nnatural selection because of the benefits of group foraging. It seems unlikely that a display audible for several\nkilometers, such as the yell, would have evolved solely\nas a status signal. Quieter vocalizations or posturing,\nseem more likely because they would suffice for the first\nfunction. In typical jury-rigged fashion natural selection\nhas embellished an existing behavior to serve a new function rather than create a new behavior. As a result, the\nproximate and ultimate reasons for yelling do not coincide.\nAcknowledgements.

Chick-a-dee calls of the Mexican Chickadee (Parus sclateri) are composed of\ncombinations of three common note types (A, C and D) and one very rare type (B). Calls\nhave the invariant sequence of notes A-B-C-D, where any note type may be omitted, given\nonce or repeated a variable number of times before transiting to the next type. The B and\nC notes are phonologically similar to the B and C notes of chick-a-dee calls of the Black-\ncapped Chickadee (P. atricapillus), but the A note is markedly different and the D note\nsomewhat different from equivalent notes of the congener. A total of 2,071 calls recorded\nyielded 60 different call types, and Zipf-Mandelbrot plots show that the call system is \"open\";\nas the sample size is increased new call types will be found without demonstrable bound.\nIn relatively undisturbed contexts (with mate on territory, in fall flocks, alone in fall) birds\ngave mainly [A][D] calls with lesser numbers of [A] and [C] calls, where brackets indicate\nvariable repetition of note types. In disturbed contexts (mobbing plastic Great Horned Owl,\nmobbing speaker playing calls of the Northern Pygmy-Owl, observer sitting under the nest\ncavity) the birds gave more [C] calls with [A][C] as well. In the longest mobbing session to\nowl calls, birds gave mainly [A] calls when approaching, switched to [C] calls while flying\nabout the speaker, and then resumed [A] calls and moved offwhen the playback was stopped.\nOutside of human language, this is the second truly combinatorial system of vocal com-\nmunication found in animals, the first being chick-a-dee calls of the Black-capped Chickadee.\nThis study provides the first data substantiating quantitative differences in calls from different\ncontexts, an important step toward understanding what kinds of information combinatorial\nchick-a-dee calls encode.\nKey words: Parus sclateri; Mexican Chickadee; vocalizations; calls; syntax; mobbing;\nflocks.\nINTRODUCTION\nAll tit species of the subgenus Poecile (genus Par-\nus) appear to give combinatorial \"chick-a-dee\"\ncalls (Hailman 1989), but this complicated call\nsystem has heretofore been analyzed quantita-\ntively only in the Black-capped Chickadee, P.\natricapillus (Hailman et al. 1985, 1987; Hailman\nand Ficken 1986). Chick-a-dee calls of the Mex-\nican Chickadee (P. sclateri) were first recorded\nby Dixon and Martin (1979), whose spectro-\ngrams (their figures la and b, p. 422) show two\nkinds of notes. Ficken (1990a) found that in a\nsample of over 1,000 recorded calls, four types\nof notes were given but one of them only rarely\n(see also Ficken and Nocedal 1992). The present\nstudy, based on further field work including\nmobbing experiments, (1) describes the acous-\ntical features and analyzes the syntactical struc-\nture of the Mexican Chickadee's calls, (2) co\npares these results with those from Black-cap\nChickadees, and (3) documents differences\ncalling in different contexts.\nChick-a-dee calls are of special interest be\ncause these compose the only presently doc\nmented combinatorial system of animal com\nmunication outside of human language.\nBlack-capped Chickadee uses four note ty\n(Ficken et al. 1978) in combination to create hu\ndreds of different call types (Hailman et al. 19\nThe note types (designated A, B, C and D) oc\nin the fixed sequence A-B-C-D, where any n\ntype may be omitted, given once, or repeat\nvariable number of times before transiting to\nnext note type within the call.

De-\nspite extensive analyses of syntactical structure,\nthe communicative significance of chick-a-dee\ncalls remains elusive. The present study of the\nMexican Chickadee provides not only the first\ncomparative data on syntax in another species\nbut also an important first step toward under-\nstanding differences in calls in different behav-\nioral contexts.\nMETHODS\nAll recordings were made at or in the vicinity of\nRustler Park in the Chiricahua Mountains (Co-\nchise County) in southeastern Arizona. Record-\nings were made by M.S.F. in October 1985, and\nMay and October 1986 (Ficken 1990a); further\nfield work by the three authors together was con-\nducted in April 1990 and March 1991, by M.S.F.\nin May 1991, and by the three authors together\nin April 1992.\nCalls were divided into four principal contexts\nof recording: (1) with mate on the breeding ter-\nritory, (2) in mixed-species flocks in the fall, (3)\nwhen disturbed by the presence of an observer\nnear the nest, and (4) when mobbing a speaker\nplaying the call of a Northern Pygmy-Owl, Glau-\ncidium gnoma. In addition, small samples of vo-\ncalizations were taped in two other contexts: (5)\nlone birds in the fall and (6) mobbing a plastic\nmodel of a Great Horned Owl, Bubo virginianus.\nThe mobbing experiments using owl tapes were\nconducted at five different sites. The partially\ndiurnal Northern Pygmy-Owl takes small birds\nand is common in the study site; during one ex-\nperiment, an owl answered the playback from\nacross a canyon. In two experiments tapes were\nplayed back from a Marantz PMD 430 Profes-\nsional cassette recorder through a Realistic Min-\nimus-0.6 amplified speaker near the ground on\na log or stump. In the other three experiments,\ntapes were played back from a Sony Walkman\nProfessional cassette recorder through a Sony\nSRS-27 amplified speaker. All playbacks attract-\ned a number of small forest species besides Mex-\nican Chickadees.\nMost of the recordings were made on a Sony\nWalkman Professional cassette tape recorder\n(details in Ficken 1990a, 1990b), with further\nrecordings of mobbing experiments made with\na Sony 8 mm camcorder. Tapes were analyzed\nby M.S.F. with a Kay 7800 Digital Sona-Graph\n(150 Hz filter band width). Note types (described\nin the Results) were classified by eye and written\non data sheets. In all, 2,045 calls were analyzed\n(a few occurred in other contexts with insufficient\nsample sizes for analysis). Data on the note com-\nposition and context of each call were read into\na database and made accessible to mainframes\nand microcomputers for analyses. Analyses were\nbasically a subset of those performed on calls of\nBlack-capped Chickadees by Hailman et al.\n(1985), designed by J.P.H. and programmed by\nE.D.H. Most of the special analytical programs\nwere written in PASCAL and run on microcom-\nputers.\nContingency tables were analyzed statistically\nusing \"computer-intensive\" methods of the pub-\nlicly available software MONTE CARLO RXC\nwritten for the Apple Macintosh by W. R. Engels\nof the University of Wisconsin-Madison, De-\npartment of Genetics. Such analyses provide a\nmore sensitive and accurate assessment than Chi-\nsquare methods often applied to such data (En-\ngels 1988). At least 1,000 trials were run for a\ngiven test to create the distribution against which\nthe data were compared. Sequential analysis by\nthe method of Markov chains was done with\nUNCERT, publicly available software for DOS\ncomputers copyrighted by E.D.H. and J.P.H.\nRESULTS\nPHONOLOGY\nChick-a-dee call systems as a whole are doubtle\nhomologous among species possessing them. Tw\nof the Mexican Chickadee's note types differ\nsomewhat in acoustical structure from those of\nthe Black-capped Chickadee, so they might not\nbe homologous. Unlike the basically chevron-\nshaped A note of the Black-capped Chickadee,\nthe Mexican Chickadee's A note (Fig. 1) is fre-\nquency modulated at a high rate, giving it a buzz-\ning aspect to the human ear. Buzzing notes char-\nacterize other vocalizations of the Mexican\nChickadee as well (Dixon and Martin 1979; Fick-\nen 1990a, 1990b). The A note usually sweeps\ndownward in frequency during its duration (Fig.\n1) but the magnitude of the decline is variable.\nDixon and Martin (1979, Fig. la) showed a call\nwith three A notes that lacked this frequency\ndownsweep completely, and there seems to be a\ncontinuum in the slope of the downsweep. The\nA note was common (1965 notes recorded), com-\nprising 28.4% of all notes.\nThis content downloaded from\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n129.2.89.26 on Tue, 13 Jan 2026 19:02:43 UTC��������������\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms72 M.

The D note varies from hav-\ning a distinctly banded frequency structure (Fig.\nla) to being nearly uniformly noisy (Fig. Ic). The\nMexican Chickadee's D note often has an onset\n\"spike\" of higher frequency (also evident in spec-\ntrograms of Dixon and Martin 1979, and Ficken\n1990a). The 1,080 D notes recorded comprise\n15.6% of the sample. When A and D notes occur\nin the same call (always in the order A-D), they\nmay be independently uttered (Fig. 1 a), or more\ntypically the last A in a sequence merges with\nthe first D note to form a sort of contracted note\nwe designate by \"A/D\" (Figs. ib, c). The A part\nof this contraction is variable in duration, but\nusually much shorter than a typical A. Rarely,\npeculiar phonations occur in recordings, as in\nFigure 1 d where an A-like note occurs before an\nA/D-like contraction.\nIt might be that some variations in A notes\nare communicatively significant. Single A notes,\nnot combined with other As or other note types,\nare particularly variable. Among the 6,918 notes\nrecorded, 34 single A notes of unusually low\nacoustical frequency were found (Fig. 2a). These\nmay represent a rare but distinct subtype of A\nnotes, treated here as A notes but deserving of\nfurther study. The Mexican Chickadee also com-\nmonly utters high frequency notes that resemble\nbrief A notes (Fig. 2b) but are much shorter and\nnever combined with other notes into multi-note\ncalls. These notes appear to be related to or var-\niants of \"tseets,\" of which Ficken (1990a) re-\ncorded only six examples. These A-like notes are\nnot included in the analyses below.\nThe B note, which was very rare (3 occurrences\nin 6,918 notes), is chevron-shaped (Fig. 2d) and\nsimilar to the B note of the Black-capped Chick-\nadee. The C note, which was the commonest type\n(3,870 recorded, comprising 55.9% of all notes),\nis a \"noisy chevron\" (Figs. 2c, d), again similar\nto the C note of the Black-capped Chickadee.\nThe C notes were usually uttered in distinct cou-\nplets (Fig. 2e), another variation of phonology\nworthy of further study.\nThe duration of a given type of note varies, in\nsome cases markedly (Table 1), depending upon\nthe type of call and where the note falls within\nthe call. Internote intervals vary from about 50\nto 90 msec for various types, but the only sys-\ntematic variation found was a bimodal distri-\nbution of C-C intervals (shorter intervals within\nthan between couplets). The interval between the\nlast note of one call and the first note of the next\nis one to two orders of magnitude longer than\ninternote intervals within calls, thus defining the\ncall as a natural unit of phonation.\nNotes of the Mexican Chickadee (especially\nthe A and D notes) are noticeably longer than\nthose of the Black-capped Chickadee (Table 1)\nwhereas the number of notes in a call is notice-\nThis content downloaded from\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n129.2.89.26 on Tue, 13 Jan 2026 19:02:43 UTC��������������\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms74 M.

The longest in\nHailman et al. (1985) was 24 notes, and that\nsample did not include predator contexts, where\ncalls are apparently often longer (Apel 1985).\nTable 1 contains several examples of how the\nplacement of a note affects its duration. For ex-\nample, the A note of single-A calls is longer than\neither note of an AA call, but not as long as the\nfirst A that is followed by an A/D contraction to\ncompose a call. Similarly the D part of an A/D\ncontraction is shorter if the contraction is pre-\nceded by an A note than if the contraction is\nitself the entire call. The frequency characteris-\ntics of notes may also vary somewhat according\nto their placement within calls (Table 1).\nSYNTAX\nMarkov chain analysis showed that the sequence\nof notes within a call follows the same rule as in\nthe Black-capped Chickadee: note types always\noccur in the order A-B-C-D (no exceptions in\n2,071 calls), where any note type may be omitted\nentirely, given once, or repeated a variable num-\nber of times. The first-order Markov chain (Fig.\n3) reveals the principal syntactic structure. Calls\nbegin with A or C (less than 1% begin with B or\nD). If beginning with A, that note-type repeats,\ntransits to D, or ends the call; if transiting to D,\nthat note repeats or ends the call. If the call begins\nwith C, that note most commonly repeats, or\nends the call.\nFrom Figure 3 one may infer that calls will\ncommonly have the structure [A], [C] or [A][D],\nwhere the enclosure of the note type in square\nbrackets denotes possible repetition. Other call\nstructures should be much rarer. Categories such\nas [A][D] are termed sequence types, and each\nmay include many distinct call types such as AD,\nAAD, AAAAD, ADD, ADDDD, and so on.\nThere are 15 such sequence types possible, but\nbecause of the rarity of B notes five of these did\nnot occur in the record: [B], [B][D], [A][B][C],\n[B][C][D], and [A][B][C][D]. The commonest se-\nquence types were: 735 [A][D] calls, 664 [C] and\n517 [A], as expected from Figure 3. Two se-\nquence types occurred with sufficient frequency\nto be of interest: 88 [A][C] and 30 [C][D]. The\nremaining types were very rare: 7 [D], 2 [A][C][D],\nand 1 each [A][B], [B][C], and [A][B][D].\nThe departure of Mexican Chickadee calls from\na first-order Markov process was small. The\nmaximum uncertainty possible with four note-\ntypes is log2 4 = 2 bits/note, but the unequal\nfrequencies of note types yielded a zero-order\nMarkov chain of only 1.21 bits/note. First-order\nanalysis reveals a large drop to only 0.36 bit/\nnote, which would be a true first-order Markov\nprocess only if all uncertainty were removed.\nThis content downloaded from\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n129.2.89.26 on Tue, 13 Jan 2026 19:02:43 UTC��������������\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms76 M. S. FICKEN, E. D. HAILMAN AND J. P. HAILMAN\nSecond-order analysis showed a small drop to\n0.21 bit/note, meaning that long-range con-\nstraints are relatively unimportant in the calls.\nPut differently, the next note to occur can be\npredicted well from the previous one but know-\ning longer ordered-strings of previous notes hardly\nimproves predictability.\nOPENNESS\nA major finding in the Black-capped Chickadee\nwas that the call system is \"open\" (Hailman et\nal. 1985): as the sample size of calls is increased,\nthe number of different call types increases with-\nout demonstrable bound. A call type is defined\nas any different combination of notes; thus A,\nCC, AC, AAACC and ACCCCCC are all differ-\nent call types. In this study we found 60 different\ncall types in the 2,071 calls recorded, and as in\nthe Black-capped Chickadee these call types var-\nied widely in frequency of occurrence. For ex-\nample, there were 783 calls of the type AD but\nonly one of the type ADDDD.\nThe test for openness is made by a Zipf-Man-\ndelbrot plot of the probability of occurrence (P)\nas a function of occurrence rank (r) on log axes.\nMandelbrot's (1953) formula P = i(r + k)s for\na fitted function has three constants: the intercept\n(i), curvature factor (k) and asymptotic slope (s),\nwhich is always negative. To show openness it\nis not necessary to provide a fitted function but\nmerely to show that the plotted curve reaches a\nnon-zero asymptotic slope. Figure 4 shows this\nproperty for the Mexican Chickadee, both with\nall data combined (top curve) and plotted sep-\narately by the six contexts. Even the curves them-\nselves for the different contexts are remarkably\nsimilar, reaching about the same asymptotic\nslopes at their right-hand sides. The curves dem-\nonstrate that the call system of the Mexican\nChickadee, like that of the Black-capped Chick-\nadee, is open and hence more new call types will\nbe found if the sample is increased.\nDIFFERENCES AMONG CONTEXTS\nThe distribution of calls among the sequence types\ndiffered according to context of recording (Fig.\n5). For purposes of statistical comparison among\ncontexts, calls were considered in five categories:\n[A], [C], [A][D], [A][C] and \"other\" (all the re-\nmaining sequence types combined). As each re-\ncording context was independent of the others,\nevery possible pair of contexts was compared in\na 2 x 5 contingency table using the Monte Carlo\ntechnique (see Methods). All pairs of contexts\ndiffered significantly (P's < 0.001) except two\ninvolving the small sample size of lone birds: th\ndifference from \"with mate\" is marginal (P\n0.06) and from \"fall flocks\" non-significant (P\n0.19).\nWhen undisturbed on territory with the mate,\nalmost three-quarters of calls were of the [A][D]\nsequence type (Fig. 5a). When in mixed-species\nfall flocks (Fig. 5b) or alone (Fig. 5c), only about\nhalf of calls were [A][D], with [A] and [C] calls\nmaking up most of the other half. In the former\ncase, there were also a few calls of the [A][C] type\nand other types. When there was an external dis-\nturbance (right column of diagrams in Fig. 5),\nthe distribution of sequence types was markedly\ndifferent, with [C] and [A][C] together always\nmaking up at least half of all calls. When dis-\nturbed by a Great Horned Owl model, birds gave\nmany [A][C] calls (Fig. 5d). When mobbing a\nNorthern Pygmy-Owl tape, [A] and [C] calls were\ncommoner (Fig. 5e), and when disturbed by the\nobserver sitting about 6 m from the nest, [C] calls\npredominated (Fig. 5f).\nOWL-TAPE PLAYBACK EXPERIMENTS\nMobbing experiments provide a means of study\ning calls in detail because there is a specific locu\nin space to which the mobbing birds attend an\nall individuals present behave similarly. Exper-\niments were conducted at five sites from March\nto May of various years. The experiments, using\nplayback tapes of Northern Pygmy-Owl calls,\ngenerally attracted one pair of Mexican Chick-\nadees, often with small songbirds of other spe-\ncies. The chickadees gave 20 to 50 calls and then\ndeparted with the playback still running. One\nexperiment brought in several chickadees for a\nlong period, and the results are analyzed sepa-\nrately below. The results of the other four ex-\nperiments are shown in Figure 6, which plots the\ncumulative frequency of each call sequence type\nthrough the experiment.\nEvery experiment shown in Figure 6 yielded\na similar but unique set of results. The experi-\nment of 22 March was made about half-way on\nthe road to Rustler Park. This playback probably\nevoked calls from a single bird, which did not\nclosely approach the speaker. In all four exper-\niments one sequence type predominated, and that\ntype of call was given at an approximately equal\nrate (constant slopes in Fig. 6) throughout the\nexperiment. The predominant type was [A][D]\nThis content downloaded from\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n129.2.89.26 on Tue, 13 Jan 2026 19:02:43 UTC��������������\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/termsMEXICAN CHICKADEE CALLS 77\n1\nALL CALLS\n1.---....... \"(N=2071)\n\" .001 C~ bmate\nS... . o..0 .0001\n. \"O\" -. flock0 'O(N=1013)alone\nt (N=35)\nI)\n0 observer\n\" r (N=443)O\n-.. pygmyA horned (N=263)(N=36)\n1 10 100\nr (occu\nFIGURE 4.

Calls contain-\ning the A note were given during approach (and\nretreat) from the site, but there is a difference\nbetween [A] and [A][D] calls. In mobbing trials,\n[A] calls were most often strings such as AA,\nAAA, and AAAA, unlike single A notes given\nin other contexts; furthermore, A-strings given\nin mobbing trials seemed sometimes to be given\nin flight. By contrast, [A][D] calls were given only\nby perched birds. These birds were moving to-\nward the site in short flights, but seemed never\nto utter any call containing a D note while ac-\ntually in flight.\nDISCUSSION\nCOMPARISONS WITH THE BLACK-CAPPED\nCHICKADEE\nThe overall structure of chick-a-dee calling in the\nMexican Chickadee is similar to that of the Black-\ncapped Chickadee (Hailman et al. 1985). Ther\nare four note types, they are combined into unit\ncalls with very short internote intervals com\npared with intervals between calls, and they oc\ncur in the invariable sequence A-B-C-D within\ncalls, where any note type may be omitted en-\ntirely, given once, or repeated a variable numbe\nof times. The note types are structurally simila\nin the two chickadees, with B and C notes bein\nnearly identical. The calls are given by both sex\nes, throughout the year, and in a wide variety of\ncontexts. In both species the [A][D] sequence typ\nis the commonest overall. Both call systems ar\nopen to new call types as the sample size increas\nes, and are the only communication systems out-\nside of human language to be proven open.\nThe chick-a-dee calls of the two species do\ndiffer, however, in many ways. The A notes o\nthe Mexican Chickadee are markedly differen\nfrom those of the Black-capped Chickadee, and\neven the D notes are dissimilar (as noted by Dix\nThis content downloaded from\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n129.2.89.26 on Tue, 13 Jan 2026 19:02:43 UTC��������������\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms80 M.

When the owl tape was turned off\nabruptly resumed.\non and Martin 1979). In both cases, though, the\nnote types may reflect origins from a common\nancestral source: the Black-capped Chickadee's\nA note is a single chevron, the Mexican Chick-\nadee's a continuous chain of short chevrons run\ntogether (Fig. 1, above) so as to sound distinctly\nbuzzing to the human ear. Similarly, the D notes\nof both species are the longest note type, cover\na wide frequency spectrum, and may be distinctly\nbanded into emphasized frequency components\nor more uniformly distributed to compose a noisy\nnote.\nMajor differences are in duration, with the A\nnotes of the Mexican Chickadee being highly\nvariable in duration according to the other note\ntypes with which they occur (means from 120 to\n170 msec in Table 1, for A notes not contracted\nwith D's). By comparison, the A notes of the\nBlack-capped Chickadee are uniformly shorter\nat about 45 msec (Hailman et al. 1985: 195, Ta-\nble 1). Similarly, the Mexican Chickadee's un-\ncontracted D note averages 270 msec (Table 1,\nabove), whereas the Black-capped Chickadee's\nD notes average about 130 msec (Hailman et al.\n1985: 195, Table 1).\nThe rarity of B notes renders the Mexican\nChickadee's calls less diverse than those of its\ncongener, and the total note length of calls is\nmuch shorter. The more variable duration of the\nMexican Chickadee's notes may in some sense\nreplace the more variable number of note repe-\ntitions given by the Black-capped Chickadee. The\nrarity of B notes and the shorter note length of\ncalls means that the Mexican Chickadee's utter-\nances tend to be syntactically simpler, although\nnot necessarily semantically simpler (especially\nif duration of notes encodes useful information).\nGood contextual analyses of Black-capped\nChickadee calls have not been published, but\nsome comparison of mobbing situations between\nthe two species may be made preliminarily. The\nMexican Chickadee utters primarily [C] or [A][C]\ncalls when greatly disturbed or mobbing (Figs.\n5-7, above). An unpublished thesis of Apel (1985)\nshowed that Black-capped Chickadees give pri-\nmarily [D] calls or other sequence types contain-\ning D notes. Similarly, Lambrechts and J. P.\nHailman (in prep.) found that the Black-capped\nChickadees mobbing a stuffed owl near the nest\ngave elevated proportions of [D] and [A][B][D]\nThis content downloaded from\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n129.2.89.26 on Tue, 13 Jan 2026 19:02:43 UTC��������������\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/termsMEXICAN CHICKADEE CALLS 81\ncalls, with hardly any calls of any kind containing\nC notes. There are important differences in the\ndetailed contexts among these three studies, but\nthe difference in results is so striking as to suggest\na fundamentally different semantic structure in\nthe two chickadee species. By Marler's (1955)\nclassic criterion that mobbing calls should con-\nsist of short, broad frequency notes repeated, both\nchickadee species qualify. The Mexican Chick-\nadee's D notes may be too long for effectively\nrapid repetition, whereas its C note more nearly\nmeets the required characteristics. However, the\nC note of the Black-capped Chickadee is very\nsimilar to that of the Mexican Chickadee, so it\nremains unclear why the former species do not\nseem to employ C notes in its mobbing calls. In\nany case, the former impression that D and\nD-like notes were the \"mobbing calls\" of Parus\n(e.g., Thielcke 1968) is too simple a view of the\ncomplex vocalizations of tits.\nSEMANTICS\nWhat chick-a-dee calls \"mean\" (what kind of\ninformation they encode) is a formidable prob-\nlem because of the complexity of the calling sys-\ntem and the fact that chick-a-dee calls occur in\nvirtually every definable context. At one extreme\nis the possibility that chick-a-dee syntax is sim-\nply some by-product of phonation, such that all\ncalls are semantically equivalent, carrying little\nmore information than the species identity and\nposition in space of the caller. At the other ex-\ntreme is the possibility that each of the hundreds\nof call types has its own distinct meaning, like\nwords in a dictionary. Hailman et al. (1985, 1987)\nfavored an intermediate view for the Black-\ncapped Chickadee, suggesting that each note type\nmeans something different and repetitions of note\ntypes within calls serve as modifiers denoting\n\"intensity.\" The present results on the Mexican\nChickadee support this hypothesis by the find-\nings of distinctly different suites of sequence types\nin different contexts (Fig. 5, above) and details\nof calls given during mobbing situations (e.g.,\nFig. 7, above). Comparable contextual differ-\nences have yet to be reported for the Black-\ncapped Chickadee.\nEven though different suites of sequence types\ncharacterize different contexts, the fact that the\nsame note types, sequence types and call types\ncan occur in different contexts suggests that note\ntypes encode information common to a variety\nof situations. Hailman et al. (1985, 1987) sug-\ngested that this encoded information related pri-\nmarily to the position and movements of the\ncaller in space, especially relative to external ob-\njects such as conspecifics, the nest, a human ob-\nserver, or a potential predator. The present re-\nsults on the Mexican Chickadee support that view\nand give it further substance. In contexts where\nbirds are moving through the environment with\nlittle obvious disturbance except that caused by\nconspecifics, Mexican Chickadees utter primar-\nily [A] and [A][D] calls (Fig. 5a-c, above). These\nsame two sequence types characterize birds mov-\ning toward the site of an owl playback (Figs. 6\nand 7, above), and sometimes when leaving the\nsite (Fig. 7). The D note is always given while\nperched whereas the A note seems to be given\nsometimes in flight as well.\nA preliminary interpretation may therefore be\nformulated as follows. A notes indicate a rest-\nlessness (a bird ready to fly or already in flight)\nwhereas a D note indicates that the caller is\nperched and hence indexes its location in space.\nThe [A] sequence type in undisturbed birds con-\nsists mainly of single A notes, but in birds ap-\nproaching a mobbing site AA and AAA call types\nare especially common. Thus, the repetition of\nA might indicate speed of movement or high\n\"intensity\" of restlessness. The [C] calls of the\nMexican Chickadee are given most commonly\nin disturbed situations (Fig. 5d-f, above), where\n[A][C] calls are also common. Furthermore, when\nintensely mobbing an owl playback, the birds\ngave nearly pure [C] calls (Fig. 7), as they did to\nthe human observer at the nest (Fig. 5f). The C\nnote is most often given by a perched bird that\nis pivoting while it calls, but may sometimes be\ngiven in flight. In the Black-capped Chickadee a\nC note given in flight has been correlated prelim-\ninarily with a sudden swerve or change in direc-\ntion (Hailman et al. 1985), but our videotapes\ncannot document the same phenomenon for cer-\ntain in the Mexican Chickadee. That [C] calls,\nand even a few [A][C] calls, occur in relatively\nundisturbed situations (Figs. 5a-c) may indicate\nmild disturbance by conspecifics. Therefore, C\nnotes seem to indicate a disturbing stimulus and\nthe tendency to change direction, so that when\ncombined with A notes in [A][C] calls further\nindicate a tendency to move some distance, as\nwhen flying past a playback speaker or owl mod-\nel.\nIn summary, the relatively simple structure of\nMexican Chickadee calls provides a clearer pic-\nture of the information encoded by note types\nthan is currently available from data on Black-\nThis content downloaded from\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n129.2.89.26 on Tue, 13 Jan 2026 19:02:43 UTC��������������\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms82 M.

Hauser,1 * Noam Chomsky,2 W. Tecumseh Fitch1\nWe argue that an understanding of the faculty of language requires substantial\ninterdisciplinary cooperation. We suggest how current developments in linguistics can\nbe profitably wedded to work in evolutionary biology, anthropology, psychology, and\nneuroscience. We submit that a distinction should be made between the faculty of\nlanguage in the broad sense (FLB)and in the narrow sense (FLN). FLB includes a\nsensory-motor system, a conceptual-intentional system, and the computational\nmechanisms for recursion, providing the capacity to generate an infinite range of\nexpressions from a finite set of elements. We hypothesize that FLN only includes\nrecursion and is the only uniquely human component of the faculty of language. We\nfurther argue that FLN may have evolved for reasons other than language, hence\ncomparative studies might look for evidence of such computations outside of the\ndomain of communication (for example, number, navigation, and social relations).\nIf a martian graced our planet, it would be\nstruck by one remarkable similarity among\nEarth’s living creatures and a key difference.\nConcerning similarity, it would note that all\nliving things are de-\nsigned on the basis of\nhighly conserved de-\nvelopmental systems\nthat read an (almost)\nuniversal language en-\ncoded in DNA base\npairs. As such, life is\narranged hierarchical-\nly with a foundation\nof discrete, unblend-\nable units (codons, and,\nfor the most part,\ngenes) capable of com-\nbining to create increas-\ningly complex and vir-\ntually limitless varieties\nof both species and in-\ndividual organisms. In\ncontrast, it would notice\nthe absence of a univer-\nsal code of communi-\ncation (Fig. 1).\nIf our martian nat-\nuralist were meticu-\nlous, it might note\nthat the faculty medi-\nating human communication appears remark-\nably different from that of other living crea-\ntures; it might further note that the human\nfaculty of language appears to be organized\nlike the genetic code— hierarchical, genera-\ntive, recursive, and virtually limitless with\nrespect to its scope of expression. With these\npieces in hand, this martian might begin to\nwonder how the genetic code changed in such\na way as to generate a vast number of mutu-\nally incomprehensible communication sys-\ntems across species while maintaining clarity\nof comprehension within a given species. The\nmartian would have stumbled onto some of\nthe essential problems surrounding the\nquestion of language evolution, and of how\nhumans acquired the faculty of language.\nIn exploring the problem of language evo-\nlution, it is important to distinguish between\nquestions concerning language as a commu-\nnicative system and questions concerning the\ncomputations underlying this system, such as\nthose underlying recursion. As we argue be-\nlow, many acrimonious debates in this field\nhave been launched by a failure to distinguish\nbetween these problems. According to one\nview (1), questions concerning abstract com-\nputational mechanisms are distinct from\nthose concerning communication, the latter\ntargeted at problems at the interface between\nabstract computation and both sensory-motor\nand conceptual-intentional interfaces. This\nview should not, of course, be taken as a\nclaim against a relationship between compu-\ntation and communication. It is possible, as\nwe discuss below, that key computational\ncapacities evolved for reasons other than\ncommunication but, after they proved to have\nutility in communication, were altered be-\ncause of constraints imposed at both the pe-\nriphery (e.g., what we can hear and say or see\nand sign, the rapidity with which the auditory\ncortex can process rapid temporal and spec-\n1 Department of Psychology, Harvard University,\nCambridge, MA 02138, USA. 2 Department of Linguis-\ntics and Philosophy, Massachusetts Institute of Tech-\nnology, Cambridge, MA 02138, USA.\n*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

One of the\noldest problems among theorists is the\n“shared versus unique” distinction. Most cur-\nrent commentators agree that, although bees\ndance, birds sing, and chimpanzees grunt,\nthese systems of communication differ qual-\nitatively from human language. In particular,\nanimal communication systems lack the rich\nexpressive and open-ended power of human\nlanguage (based on humans’ capacity for re-\ncursion). The evolutionary puzzle, therefore,\nlies in working out how we got from there to\nhere, given this apparent discontinuity. A sec-\nond issue revolves around whether the evo-\nlution of language was gradual versus salta-\ntional; this differs from the first issue because\na qualitative discontinuity between extant\nspecies could have evolved gradually, involv-\ning no discontinuities during human evolu-\ntion. Finally, the “continuity versus exapta-\ntion” issue revolves around the problem of\nwhether human language evolved by gradual\nextension of preexisting communication sys-\ntems, or whether important aspects of lan-\nguage have been exapted away from their\nprevious adaptive function (e.g., spatial or\nnumerical reasoning, Machiavellian social\nscheming, tool-making).\nResearchers have adopted extreme or in-\ntermediate positions regarding these basically\nindependent questions, leading to a wide\nvariety of divergent viewpoints on the evo-\nlution of language in the current literature.\nThere is, however, an emerging consensus\nthat, although humans and animals share a\ndiversity of important computational and\nperceptual resources, there has been sub-\nstantial evolutionary remodeling since we\ndiverged from a common ancestor some 6\nmillion years ago. The empirical challenge\nis to determine what was inherited un-\nchanged from this common ancestor, what\nhas been subjected to minor modifications,\nand what (if anything) is qualitatively new.\nThe additional evolutionary challenge is to\ndetermine what selectional pressures led to\nadaptive changes over time and to under-\nstand the various constraints that channeled\nthis evolutionary process. Answering these\nquestions requires a collaborative effort\namong linguists, biologists, psychologists,\nand anthropologists.\nOne aim of this essay is to promote a\nstronger connection between biology and\nlinguistics by identifying points of contact\nand agreement between the fields. Al-\nthough this interdisciplinary marriage was\ninaugurated more than 50 years ago, it has\nnot yet been fully consummated. We hope\nto further this goal by, first, helping to\nclarify the biolinguistic perspective on lan-\nguage and its evolution (2–7). We then\nreview some promising empirical ap-\nproaches to the evolution of the language\nfaculty, with a special focus on\ncomparative work with non-\nhuman animals, and conclude\nwith a discussion of how in-\nquiry might profitably advance,\nhighlighting some outstanding\nproblems.\nWe make no attempt to be\ncomprehensive in our coverage of\nrelevant or interesting topics and\nproblems. Nor is it our goal to\nreview the history of the field.\nRather, we focus on topics that\nmake important contact between\nempirical data and theoretical po-\nsitions about the nature of the lan-\nguage faculty. We believe that if\nexplorations into the problem of\nlanguage evolution are to progress,\nwe need a clear explication of the\ncomputational requirements for\nlanguage, the role of evolutionary\ntheory in testing hypotheses of\ncharacter evolution, and a research\nprogram that will enable a produc-\ntive interchange between linguists\nand biologists.\nDefining the Target: Two\nSenses of the Faculty of\nLanguage\nThe word “language” has highly divergent\nmeanings in different contexts and disci-\nplines. In informal usage, a language is un-\nderstood as a culturally specific communica-\ntion system (English, Navajo, etc.). In the\nvarieties of modern linguistics that concern\nus here, the term “language” is used quite\ndifferently to refer to an internal component\nof the mind/brain (sometimes called “internal\nlanguage” or “I-language”). We assume that\nthis is the primary object of interest for the\nstudy of the evolution and function of the\nlanguage faculty. However, this biologically\nand individually grounded usage still leaves\nmuch open to interpretation (and misunder-\nstanding). For example, a neuroscientist\nmight ask: What components of the human\nnervous system are recruited in the use of\nlanguage in its broadest sense? Because any\naspect of cognition appears to be, at least in\nprinciple, accessible to language, the broadest\nanswer to this question is, probably, “most of\nit.” Even aspects of emotion or cognition not\nreadily verbalized may be influenced by lin-\nguistically based thought processes. Thus,\nthis conception is too broad to be of much\nuse. We therefore delineate two more restrict-\ned conceptions of the faculty of language, one\nbroader and more inclusive, the other more\nrestricted and narrow (Fig. 2).\nFaculty of language— broad sense\n(FLB). FLB includes an internal computa-\ntional system (FLN, below) combined with\nat least two other organism-internal sys-\nFig. 2. A schematic representation of organism-external and -internal factors related to the faculty of language.\nFLB includes sensory-motor, conceptual-intentional, and other possible systems (which we leave open); FLN\nincludes the core grammatical computations that we suggest are limited to recursion. See text for more\ncomplete discussion.\nS C I E N C E ’ S C O M P A S S\n22 NOVEMBER 2002 VOL 298SCIENCE www.sciencemag.org1570\ntems, which we call “sensory-motor” and\n“conceptual-intentional.” Despite debate on\nthe precise nature of these systems, and\nabout whether they are substantially shared\nwith other vertebrates or uniquely adapted\nto the exigencies of language, we take as\nuncontroversial the existence of some bio-\nlogical capacity of humans that allows us\n(and not, for example, chimpanzees) to\nreadily master any human language without\nexplicit instruction. FLB includes this ca-\npacity, but excludes other organism-\ninternal systems that are necessary but not\nsufficient for language (e.g., memory, res-\npiration, digestion, circulation, etc.).\nFaculty of language—narrow sense\n(FLN). FLN is the abstract linguistic compu-\ntational system alone, independent of the oth-\ner systems with which it interacts and inter-\nfaces. FLN is a component of FLB, and the\nmechanisms underlying it are some subset of\nthose underlying FLB.\nOthers have agreed on the need for a\nrestricted sense of “language” but have sug-\ngested different delineations. For example,\nLiberman and his associates (8) have argued\nthat the sensory-motor systems were specifi-\ncally adapted for language, and hence should\nbe considered part of FLN. There is also a\nlong tradition holding that the conceptual-\nintentional systems are an intrinsic part of\nlanguage in a narrow sense. In this article, we\nleave these questions open, restricting atten-\ntion to FLN as just defined but leaving the\npossibility of a more inclusive definition\nopen to further empirical research.\nThe internal architecture of FLN, so con-\nceived, is a topic of much current research\nand debate (4). Without prejudging the is-\nsues, we will, for concreteness, adopt a par-\nticular conception of this architecture. We\nassume, putting aside the precise mecha-\nnisms, that a key component of FLN is a\ncomputational system (narrow syntax) that\ngenerates internal representations and maps\nthem into the sensory-motor interface by the\nphonological system, and into the conceptu-\nal-intentional interface by the (formal) se-\nmantic system; adopting alternatives that\nhave been proposed would not materially\nmodify the ensuing discussion. All approach-\nes agree that a core property of FLN is recur-\nsion, attributed to narrow syntax in the con-\nception just outlined. FLN takes a finite set of\nelements and yields a potentially infinite ar-\nray of discrete expressions. This capacity of\nFLN yields discrete infinity (a property that\nalso characterizes the natural numbers). Each\nof these discrete expressions is then passed to\nthe sensory-motor and conceptual-intentional\nsystems, which process and elaborate this\ninformation in the use of language. Each\nexpression is, in this sense, a pairing of sound\nand meaning. It has been recognized for thou-\nsands of years that language is, fundamental-\nly, a system of sound-meaning connections;\nthe potential infiniteness of this system has\nbeen explicitly recognized by Galileo, Des-\ncartes, and the 17th-century “philosophical\ngrammarians” and their successors, notably\nvon Humboldt. One goal of the study of FLN\nand, more broadly, FLB is to discover just\nhow the faculty of language satisfies these\nbasic and essential conditions.\nThe core property of discrete infinity is\nintuitively familiar to every language user.\nSentences are built up of discrete units: There\nare 6-word sentences and 7-word sentences,\nbut no 6.5-word sentences. There is no long-\nest sentence (any candidate sentence can be\ntrumped by, for example, embedding it in\n“Mary thinks that . . .”), and there is no non-\narbitrary upper bound to sentence length. In\nthese respects, language is directly analogous\nto the natural numbers (see below).\nAt a minimum, then, FLN includes the ca-\npacity of recursion. There are many organism-\ninternal factors, outside FLN or FLB, that im-\npose practical limits on the usage of the system.\nFor example, lung capacity imposes limits on\nthe length of actual spoken sentences, whereas\nworking memory imposes limits on the com-\nplexity of sentences if they are to be under-\nstandable. Other limitations—for example, on\nconcept formation or motor output speed—\nrepresent aspects of FLB, which have their own\nevolutionary histories and may have played a\nrole in the evolution of the capacities of FLN.\nNonetheless, one can profitably inquire into the\nevolution of FLN without an\nimmediate concern for these\nlimiting aspects of FLB. This\nis made clear by the observa-\ntion that, although many\naspects of FLB are shared\nwith other vertebrates, the\ncore recursive aspect of FLN\ncurrently appears to lack any\nanalog in animal communi-\ncation and possibly other do-\nmains as well. This point,\ntherefore, represents the\ndeepest challenge for a com-\nparative evolutionary ap-\nproach to language. We be-\nlieve that investigations of\nthis capacity should include\ndomains other than commu-\nnication (e.g., number, social\nrelationships, navigation).\nGiven the distinctions\nbetween FLB and FLN and\nthe theoretical distinctions\nraised above, we can define\na research space as sketched\nin Fig. 3. This research\nspace identifies, as viable,\nproblems concerning the\nevolution of sensory-motor\nsystems, of conceptual-in-\ntentional systems, and of\nFLN. The comparative ap-\nproach, to which we turn\nnext, provides a framework\nfor addressing questions\nabout each of these com-\nponents of the faculty of\nlanguage.\nThe Comparative\nApproach to Language\nEvolution\nThe empirical study of the\nevolution of language is be-\nset with difficulties. Lin-\nguistic behavior does not\nfossilize, and a long tradi-\nFig. 3. Investigations into the evolution of the faculty of language\nare confronted with a three-dimensional research space that\nincludes three comparative-evolutionary problems cross-cut by\nthe core components of the faculty of language. Thus, for each\nproblem, researchers can investigate details of the sensory-motor\nsystem, the conceptual-intentional system, FLN, and the interfac-\nes among these systems.\nS C I E N C E ’ S C O M P A S S\nwww.sciencemag.org SCIENCE VOL 29822 NOVEMBER 2002 1571\ntion of analysis of fossil skull shape and\ncranial endocasts has led to little consensus\nabout the evolution of language (7, 9). A\nmore tractable and, we think, powerful ap-\nproach to problems of language evolution is\nprovided by the comparative method, which\nuses empirical data from living species to\ndraw detailed inferences about extinct ances-\ntors (3, 10 –12). The comparative method was\nthe primary tool used by Darwin (13, 14) to\nanalyze evolutionary phenomena and contin-\nues to play a central role throughout modern\nevolutionary biology. Although scholars in-\nterested in language evolution have often ig-\nnored comparative data altogether or focused\nnarrowly on data from nonhuman primates,\ncurrent thinking in neuroscience, molecular\nbiology, and developmental biology indicates\nthat many aspects of neural and developmen-\ntal function are highly conserved, encourag-\ning the extension of the comparative method\nto all vertebrates (and perhaps beyond). For\nseveral reasons, detailed below, we believe\nthat the comparative method should play a\nmore central role in future discussions of\nlanguage evolution.\nAn overarching concern in studies of lan-\nguage evolution is with whether particular\ncomponents of the faculty of language\nevolved specifically for human language and,\ntherefore (by extension), are unique to hu-\nmans. Logically, the human uniqueness claim\nmust be based on data indicating an absence\nof the trait in nonhuman animals and, to be\ntaken seriously, requires a substantial body of\nrelevant comparative data. More concretely,\nif the language evolution researcher wishes to\nmake the claim that a trait evolved uniquely\nin humans for the function of language pro-\ncessing, data indicating that no other animal\nhas this particular trait are required.\nAlthough this line of reasoning may ap-\npear obvious, it is surprisingly common for a\ntrait to be held up as uniquely human before\nany appropriate comparative data are avail-\nable. A famous example is categorical per-\nception, which when discovered seemed so\nfinely tuned to the details of human speech as\nto constitute a unique human adaptation (15,\n16). It was some time before the same under-\nlying perceptual discontinuities were discov-\nered in chinchillas and macaques (17, 18),\nand even birds (19), leading to the opposite\nconclusion that the perceptual basis for cate-\ngorical perception is a primitive vertebrate\ncharacteristic that evolved for general audito-\nry processing, as opposed to specific speech\nprocessing. Thus, a basic and logically in-\neliminable role for comparative research on\nlanguage evolution is this simple and essen-\ntially negative one: A trait present in nonhu-\nman animals did not evolve specifically for\nhuman language, although it may be part of\nthe language faculty and play an intimate role\nin language processing. It is possible, of\ncourse, that a trait evolved in nonhuman an-\nimals and humans independently, as analogs\nrather than homologs. This would preserve\nthe possibility that the trait evolved for lan-\nguage in humans but evolved for some other\nreason in the comparative animal group. In\ncases where the comparative group is a non-\nhuman primate, and perhaps especially chim-\npanzees, the plausibility of this evolutionary\nscenario is weaker. In any case, comparative\ndata are critical to this judgment.\nDespite the crucial role of homology in\ncomparative biology, homologous traits are not\nthe only relevant source of evolutionary data.\nThe convergent evolution of similar characters\nin two independent clades, termed “analogies”\nor “homoplasies,” can be equally revealing\n(20). The remarkably similar (but nonhomolo-\ngous) structures of human and octopus eyes\nreveal the stringent constraints placed by the\nlaws of optics and the contingencies of devel-\nopment on an organ capable of focusing a sharp\nimage onto a sheet of receptors. Detailed anal-\nogies between the parts of the vertebrate and\ncephalopod eye also provide independent evi-\ndence that each component is an adaptation for\nimage formation, shaped by natural selection.\nFurthermore, the discovery that remarkably\nconservative genetic cascades underlie the de-\nvelopment of such analogous structures pro-\nvides important insights into the ways in\nwhich developmental mechanisms can\nchannel evolution (21). Thus, although po-\ntentially misleading for taxonomists, anal-\nogies provide critical data about adaptation\nunder physical and developmental con-\nstraints. Casting the comparative net more\nbroadly, therefore, will most likely reveal\nlarger regularities in evolution, helping to\naddress the role of such constraints in the\nevolution of language.\nAn analogy recognized as particularly rele-\nvant to language is the acquisition of song by\nbirds (12). In contrast to nonhuman primates,\nwhere the production of species-typical vocal-\nizations is largely innate (22), most songbirds\nlearn their species-specific song by listening to\nconspecifics, and they develop highly aberrant\nsong if deprived of such experience. Current\ninvestigation of birdsong reveals detailed and\nintriguing parallels with speech (11, 23, 24).\nFor instance, many songbirds pass through a\ncritical period in development beyond which\nthey produce defective songs that no amount of\nacoustic input can remedy, reminiscent of the\ndifficulty adult humans have in fully mastering\nnew languages. Further, and in parallel with the\nbabbling phase of vocalizing or signing human\ninfants (25), young birds pass through a phase\nof song development in which they spontane-\nously produce amorphous versions of adult\nsong, termed “subsong” or “babbling.” Al-\nthough the mechanisms underlying the acquisi-\ntion of birdsong and human language are clear-\nly analogs and not homologs, their core com-\nponents share a deeply conserved neural and\ndevelopmental foundation: Most aspects of\nneurophysiology and development—including\nregulatory and structural genes, as well as neu-\nron types and neurotransmitters—are shared\namong vertebrates. That such close parallels\nhave evolved suggests the existence of impor-\ntant constraints on how vertebrate brains can\nacquire large vocabularies of complex, learned\nsounds. Such constraints may essentially force\nnatural selection to come up with the same\nsolution repeatedly when confronted with sim-\nilar problems.\nTesting Hypotheses About the\nEvolution of the Faculty of Language\nGiven the definitions of the faculty of lan-\nguage, together with the comparative frame-\nwork, we can distinguish several plausible\nhypotheses about the evolution of its various\ncomponents. Here, we suggest two hypothe-\nses that span the diversity of opinion among\ncurrent scholars, plus a third of our own.\nHypothesis 1: FLB is strictly homologous\nto animal communication. This hypothesis\nholds that homologs of FLB, including FLN,\nexist ( perhaps in less developed or otherwise\nmodified form) in nonhuman animals (3, 10,\n26). This has historically been a popular hy-\npothesis outside of linguistics and closely\nallied fields, and has been defended by some\nin the speech sciences. According to this\nhypothesis, human FLB is composed of the\nsame functional components that underlie\ncommunication in other species.\nHypothesis 2: FLB is a derived, uniquely\nhuman adaptation for language. According\nto this hypothesis, FLB is a highly complex\nadaptation for language, on a par with the\nvertebrate eye, and many of its core compo-\nnents can be viewed as individual traits that\nhave been subjected to selection and perfect-\ned in recent human evolutionary history. This\nappears to represent the null hypothesis for\nmany scholars who take the complexity of\nlanguage seriously (27, 28). The argument\nstarts with the assumption that FLB, as a\nwhole, is highly complex, serves the function\nof communication with admirable effective-\nness, and has an ineliminable genetic compo-\nnent. Because natural selection is the only\nknown biological mechanism capable of gen-\nerating such functional complexes [the argu-\nment from design (29)], proponents of this\nview conclude that natural selection has\nplayed a powerful role in shaping many as-\npects of FLB, including FLN, and, further,\nthat many of these are without parallel in\nnonhuman animals. Although homologous\nmechanisms may exist in other animals, the\nhuman versions have been modified by nat-\nural selection to the extent that they can be\nreasonably seen as constituting novel traits,\nperhaps exapted from other contexts [e.g.,\nsocial intelligence, tool-making (7, 30 –32)].\nS C I E N C E ’ S C O M P A S S\n22 NOVEMBER 2002 VOL 298SCIENCE www.sciencemag.org1572\nHypothesis 3: Only FLN is uniquely human.\nOn the basis of data reviewed below, we hy-\npothesize that most, if not all, of FLB is based\non mechanisms shared with nonhuman animals\n(as held by hypothesis 1). In contrast, we sug-\ngest that FLN—the computational mechanism\nof recursion—is recently evolved and unique to\nour species (33, 34). According to this hypoth-\nesis, much of the complexity manifested in\nlanguage derives from complexity in the pe-\nripheral components of FLB, especially those\nunderlying the sensory-motor (speech or sign)\nand conceptual-intentional interfaces, com-\nbined with sociocultural and communicative\ncontingencies. FLB as a whole thus has an\nancient evolutionary history, long predating the\nemergence of language, and a comparative\nanalysis is necessary to understand this com-\nplex system. By contrast, according to recent\nlinguistic theory, the computations underlying\nFLN may be quite limited. In fact, we propose\nin this hypothesis that FLN comprises only the\ncore computational mechanisms of recursion as\nthey appear in narrow syntax and the mappings\nto the interfaces. If FLN is indeed this restrict-\ned, this hypothesis has the interesting effect of\nnullifying the argument from design, and thus\nrendering the status of FLN as an adaptation\nopen to question. Proponents of the idea that\nFLN is an adaptation would thus need to supply\nadditional data or arguments to support this\nviewpoint.\nThe available comparative data on animal\ncommunication systems suggest that the faculty\nof language as a whole relies on some uniquely\nhuman capacities that have evolved recently in\nthe approximately 6 million years since our\ndivergence from a chimpanzee-like common\nancestor (35). Hypothesis 3, in its strongest\nform, suggests that only FLN falls into this\ncategory (34). By this hypothesis, FLB contains\na wide variety of cognitive and perceptual\nmechanisms shared with other species, but only\nthose mechanisms underlying FLN—particu-\nlarly its capacity for discrete infinity—are\nuniquely human. This hypothesis suggests that\nall peripheral components of FLB are shared\nwith other animals, in more or less the same\nform as they exist in humans, with differences\nof quantity rather than kind (9, 34). What is\nunique to our species is quite specific to FLN,\nand includes its internal operations as well as its\ninterface with the other organism-internal sys-\ntems of FLB.\nEach of these hypotheses is plausible to\nsome degree. Ultimately, they can be distin-\nguished only by empirical data, much of which\nis currently unavailable. Before reviewing some\nof the relevant data, we briefly consider some\nkey distinctions between them. From a compar-\native evolutionary viewpoint, an important\nquestion is whether linguistic precursors were\ninvolved in communication or in something\nelse. Proponents of both hypotheses 1 and 2\nposit a direct correspondence, by descent with\nmodification, between some trait involved in\nFLB in humans and a similar trait in another\nspecies; these hypotheses differ in whether\nthe precursors functioned in communication.\nTable 1.

De-\nspite the inarguable existence of a broadly\nshared base of homologous mechanisms in-\nvolved in FLB, minor modifications to this\nfoundational system alone seem inadequate to\ngenerate the fundamental difference—discrete\ninfinity—between language and all known\nforms of animal communication. This claim is\none of several reasons why we suspect that\nhypothesis 3 may be a productive way to char-\nacterize the problem of language evolution.\nA primary issue separating hypotheses 2\nand 3 is whether the uniquely human capac-\nities of FLN constitute an adaptation. The\nviewpoint stated in hypothesis 2, especially\nthe notion that FLN in particular is a highly\nevolved adaptation, has generated much en-\nthusiasm recently [e.g., (36)], especially\namong evolutionary psychologists (37, 38).\nAt present, however, we see little reason to\nbelieve either that FLN can be anatomized\ninto many independent but interacting traits,\neach with its own independent evolutionary\nhistory, or that each of these traits could have\nbeen strongly shaped by natural selection,\ngiven their tenuous connection to communi-\ncative efficacy (the surface or phenotypic\nfunction upon which selection presumably\nacted).\nWe consider the possibility that certain spe-\ncific aspects of the faculty of language are\n“spandrels”—by-products of preexisting con-\nstraints rather than end products of a history of\nnatural selection (39). This possibility, which\nopens the door to other empirical lines of inqui-\nry, is perfectly compatible with our firm support\nof the adaptationist program. Indeed, it follows\ndirectly from the foundational notion that adap-\ntation is an “onerous concept” to be invoked\nonly when alternative explanations fail (40).\nThe question is not whether FLN in toto is\nadaptive. By allowing us to communicate an\nendless variety of thoughts, recursion is clearly\nan adaptive computation. The question is\nwhether particular components of the function-\ning of FLN are adaptations for language, spe-\ncifically acted upon by natural selection—or,\neven more broadly, whether FLN evolved for\nreasons other than communication.\nAn analogy may make this distinction\nclear. The trunk and branches of trees are\nnear-optimal solutions for providing an indi-\nvidual tree’s leaves with access to sunlight.\nFor shrubs and small trees, a wide variety of\nforms (spreading, spherical, multistalked,\netc.) provide good solutions to this problem.\nFor a towering rainforest canopy tree, how-\never, most of these forms are rendered im-\npossible by the various constraints imposed\nby the properties of cellulose and the prob-\nlems of sucking water and nutrients up to the\nleaves high in the air. Some aspects of such\ntrees are clearly adaptations channeled by\nthese constraints; others (e.g., the popping of\nxylem tubes on hot days, the propensity to be\ntoppled in hurricanes) are presumably un-\navoidable by-products of such constraints.\nRecent work on FLN (4, 41–43) suggests\nthe possibility that at least the narrow-syntactic\ncomponent satisfies conditions of highly effi-\ncient computation to an extent previously unsus-\npected. Thus, FLN may approximate a kind of\n“optimal solution” to the problem of linking\nthe sensory-motor and conceptual-intentional\nsystems. In other words, the generative process-\nes of the language system may provide a\nnear-optimal solution that satisfies the interface\nconditions to FLB. Many of the details of lan-\nguage that are the traditional focus of linguistic\nstudy [e.g., subjacency, Wh- movement, the\nexistence of garden-path sentences (4, 44)] may\nrepresent by-products of this solution, gener-\nated automatically by neural/computational\nconstraints and the structure of FLB—\ncomponents that lie outside of FLN. Even\nnovel capacities such as recursion are imple-\nmented in the same type of neural tissue as the\nrest of the brain and are thus constrained by\nbiophysical, developmental, and computation-\nal factors shared with other vertebrates. Hy-\npothesis 3 raises the possibility that structural\ndetails of FLN may result from such preexisting\nconstraints, rather than from direct shaping by\nnatural selection targeted specifically at com-\nmunication. Insofar as this proves to be true,\nsuch structural details are not, strictly speaking,\nadaptations at all. This hypothesis and the\nalternative selectionist account are both viable\nand can eventually be tested with comparative\ndata.\nComparative Evidence for the Faculty\nof Language\nStudy of the evolution of language has accel-\nerated in the past decade (45, 46). Here, we\noffer a highly selective review of some of\nthese studies, emphasizing animal work that\nseems particularly relevant to the hypotheses\nadvanced above; many omissions were nec-\nessary for reasons of space, and we firmly\nbelieve that a broad diversity of methods and\nperspectives will ultimately provide the rich-\nest answers to the problem of language evo-\nlution. For this reason, we present a broader\nsampler of the field’s offerings in Table 1.\nHow “special” is speech? Comparative\nstudy of the sensory-motor system. Starting with\nearly work on speech perception, there has been\na tradition of considering speech “special,” and\nthus based on uniquely human mechanisms\nadapted for speech perception and/or produc-\ntion [e.g., (7, 8, 47, 48)]. This perspective has\nstimulated a vigorous research program study-\ning animal speech perception and, more recent-\nly, speech production. Surprisingly, this re-\nsearch has turned up little evidence for uniquely\nhuman mechanisms special to speech, despite a\npersistent tendency to assume uniqueness even\nin the absence of relevant animal data.\nOn the side of perception, for example,\nmany species show an impressive ability to\nboth discriminate between and generalize\nover human speech sounds, using formants as\nthe critical discriminative cue (17–19, 49 –\n51). These data provide evidence not only of\ncategorical perception, but also of the ability\nto discriminate among prototypical exem-\nplars of different phonemes (52). Further, in\nthe absence of training, nonhuman primates\ncan discriminate sentences from two different\nlanguages on the basis of rhythmic differenc-\nes between them (53).\nOn the side of production, birds and non-\nhuman primates naturally produce and per-\nceive formants in their own species-typical\nvocalizations (54 –59). The results also shed\nlight on discussions of the uniquely human\nstructure of the vocal tract and the unusual\ndescended larynx of our species (7, 48, 60),\nbecause new evidence shows that several oth-\ner mammalian species also have a descended\nlarynx (61). Because these nonhuman species\nlack speech, a descended larynx clearly has\nnonphonetic functions; one possibility is ex-\naggerating apparent size. Although this par-\nticular anatomical modification undoubtedly\nplays an important role in speech production\nin modern humans, it need not have first\nevolved for this function. The descended lar-\nynx may thus be an example of classic Dar-\nwinian preadaptation.\nMany phenomena in human speech percep-\ntion have not yet been investigated in animals\n[e.g., the McGurk effect, an illusion in which\nthe syllable perceived from a talking head rep-\nresents the interaction between an articulatory\ngesture seen and a different syllable heard; see\n(62)]. However, the available data suggest a\nmuch stronger continuity between animals and\nhumans with respect to speech than previously\nbelieved. We argue that the continuity hypoth-\nesis thus deserves the status of a null hypothe-\nsis, which must be rejected by comparative\nwork before any claims of uniqueness can be\nvalidated. For now, this null hypothesis of no\ntruly novel traits in the speech domain appears\nto stand.\nThere is, however, a striking ability tied to\nspeech that has received insufficient atten-\ntion: the human capacity for vocal imitation\n(63, 64). Imitation is obviously a necessary\ncomponent of the human capacity to acquire\na shared and arbitrary lexicon, which is itself\ncentral to the language capacity. Thus, the\ncapacity to imitate was a crucial prerequisite\nof FLB as a communicative system. Vocal\nimitation and learning are not uniquely hu-\nman. Rich multimodal imitative capacities\nare seen in other mammals (dolphins) and\nsome birds ( parrots), with most songbirds\nexhibiting a well-developed vocal imitative\nS C I E N C E ’ S C O M P A S S\n22 NOVEMBER 2002 VOL 298SCIENCE www.sciencemag.org1574\ncapacity (65). What is surprising is that mon-\nkeys show almost no evidence of visually\nmediated imitation, with chimpanzees show-\ning only slightly better capacities (66). Even\nmore striking is the virtual absence of evi-\ndence for vocal imitation in either monkeys\nor apes (3). For example, intensively trained\nchimpanzees are incapable of acquiring any-\nthing but a few poorly articulated spoken\nwords, whereas parrots can readily acquire a\nlarge vocal repertoire. With respect to their\nown vocalizations, there are few convincing\nstudies of vocal dialects in primates, thereby\nsuggesting that they lack a vocal imitative\ncapacity (3, 65). Evidence for spontaneous\nvisuomanual imitation in chimpanzees is not\nmuch stronger, although with persistent train-\ning they can learn several hundred hand\nsigns. Further, even in cases where\nnonhuman animals are capable of im-\nitating in one modality (e.g., song\ncopying in songbirds), only dolphins\nand humans appear capable of imita-\ntion in multiple modalities. The de-\ntachment from modality-specific in-\nputs may represent a substantial\nchange in neural organization, one\nthat affects not only imitation but\nalso communication; only humans\ncan lose one modality (e.g., hear-\ning) and make up for this deficit by\ncommunicating with complete com-\npetence in a different modality (i.e.,\nsigning).\nOur discussion of limitations is\nnot meant to diminish the impressive\nachievements of monkeys and apes,\nbut to highlight how different the\nmechanisms underlying the produc-\ntion of human and nonhuman primate\ngestures, either vocally expressed or\nsigned, must be. After all, the aver-\nage high school graduate knows up to\n60,000 words, a vocabulary achieved\nwith little effort, especially when\ncontrasted with the herculean efforts\ndevoted to training animals. In sum,\nthe impressive ability of any normal\nhuman child for vocal imitation may\nrepresent a novel capacity that\nevolved in our recent evolutionary\nhistory, some time after the diver-\ngence from our chimpanzee-like an-\ncestors. The existence of analogs in\ndistantly related species, such as\nbirds and cetaceans, suggests consid-\nerable potential for the detailed com-\nparative study of vocal imitation. There are,\nhowever, potential traps that must be avoid-\ned, especially with respect to explorations of\nthe neurobiological substrates of imitation.\nFor example, although macaque monkeys\nand humans are equipped with so-called\n“mirror neurons” in the premotor cortex that\nrespond both when an individual acts in a\nparticular way and when the same individual\nsees someone else act in this same way (67,\n68), these neurons are not sufficient for imi-\ntation in macaques, as many have presumed:\nAs mentioned, there is no convincing evi-\ndence of vocal or visual imitation in mon-\nkeys. Consequently, as neuroimaging studies\ncontinue to explore the neural basis of imita-\ntion in humans (69 –71), it will be important\nto distinguish between the necessary and suf-\nficient neural correlates of imitation. This is\nespecially important, given that some recent\nattempts to model the evolution of language\nbegin with a hypothetical organism that is\nequipped with the capacity for imitation and\nintentionality, as opposed to working out how\nthese mechanisms evolved in the first place\n[see below; (72–74)]. If a deeper evolution-\nary exploration is desired, one dating back to\na chimpanzee-like ancestor, then we need to\nexplain how and why such capacities\nemerged from an ancestral node that lacked\nsuch abilities (75) (Fig. 4).\nThe conceptual-intentional systems of non-\nlinguistic animals. A wide variety of studies\nindicate that nonhuman mammals and birds\nhave rich conceptual representations (76, 77).\nSurprisingly, however, there is a mismatch be-\ntween the conceptual capacities of animals and\nthe communicative content of their vocal and\nvisual signals (78, 79). For example, although a\nwide variety of nonhuman primates have access\nto rich knowledge of who is related to whom, as\nwell as who is dominant and who is subordi-\nnate, their vocalizations only coarsely express\nsuch complexities.\nStudies using classical training approach-\nes as well as methods that tap spontaneous\nabilities reveal that animals acquire and use a\nwide range of abstract concepts, including\ntool, color, geometric relationships, food, and\nnumber (66, 76 – 82). More controversially,\nbut of considerable relevance to intentional\naspects of language and conditions of felici-\ntous use, some studies claim that animals\nhave a theory of mind (83– 85), including a\nsense of self and the ability to represent the\nbeliefs and desires of other group members.\nOn the side of positive support, recent studies\nof chimpanzees suggest that they recognize\nthe perceptual act of seeing as a proxy for the\nmental state of knowing (84, 86, 87). These\nFig. 4. The distribution of imitation in the animal kingdom is patchy. Some animals such as songbirds,\ndolphins, and humans have evolved exceptional abilities to imitate; other animals, such as apes and\nmonkeys, either lack such abilities or have them in a relatively impoverished form.

On the side of\nnegative support, other studies suggest that\neven chimpanzees lack a theory of mind,\nfailing, for example, to differentiate between\nignorant and knowledgeable individuals with\nrespect to intentional communication (88,\n89). Because these experiments make use of\ndifferent methods and are based on small\nsample sizes, it is not possible at present to\nderive any firm conclusions about the pres-\nence or absence of mental state attribution in\nanimals. Independently of how this contro-\nversy is resolved, however, the best evidence\nof referential communication in animals\ncomes not from chimpanzees but from a va-\nriety of monkeys and birds, species for which\nthere is no convincing evidence for a theory\nof mind.\nThe classic studies of vervet monkey\nalarm calls (90) have now been joined by\nseveral others, each using comparable meth-\nods, with extensions to different species (ma-\ncaques, Diana monkeys, meerkats, prairie\ndogs, chickens) and different communicative\ncontexts (social relationships, food, inter-\ngroup aggression) (91–97). From these stud-\nies we can derive five key points relevant to\nour analysis of the faculty of language. First,\nindividuals produce acoustically distinctive\ncalls in response to functionally important\ncontexts, including the detection of predators\nand the discovery of food. Second, the acous-\ntic morphology of the signal, although arbi-\ntrary in terms of its association with a partic-\nular context, is sufficient to enable listeners to\nrespond appropriately without requiring any\nother contextual information. Third, the num-\nber of such signals in the repertoire is small,\nrestricted to objects and events experienced\nin the present, with no evidence of creative\nproduction of new sounds for new situations.\nFourth, the acoustic morphology of the calls\nis fixed, appearing early in development, with\nexperience only playing a role in refining the\nrange of objects or events that elicit such\ncalls. Fifth, there is no evidence that calling is\nintentional in the sense of taking into account\nwhat other individuals believe or want.\nEarly interpretations of this work suggest-\ned that when animals vocalize, they are func-\ntionally referring to the objects and events\nthat they have encountered. As such, vervet\nalarm calls and rhesus monkey food calls, to\ntake two examples, were interpreted as word-\nlike, with callers referring to different kinds\nof predators or different kinds of food. More\nrecent discussions have considerably weak-\nened this interpretation, suggesting that if the\nsignal is referential at all, it is in the mind of\nthe listener who can extract information\nabout the signaler’s current context from the\nacoustic structure of the call alone (78, 95).\nDespite this evidence that animals can extract\ninformation from the signal, there are several\nreasons why additional evidence is required\nbefore such signals can be considered as pre-\ncursors for, or homologs of, human words.\nRoughly speaking, we can think of a partic-\nular human language as consisting of words and\ncomputational procedures (“rules”) for con-\nstructing expressions from them. The computa-\ntional system has the recursive property briefly\noutlined earlier, which may be a distinct human\nproperty. However, key aspects of words may\nalso be distinctively human. There are, first of\nall, qualitative differences in scale and mode of\nacquisition, which suggest that quite different\nmechanisms are involved; as pointed out above,\nthere is no evidence for vocal imitation in non-\nhuman primates, and although human children\nmay use domain-general mechanisms to ac-\nquire and recall words (98, 99), the rate at\nwhich children build the lexicon is so massively\ndifferent from nonhuman primates that one\nmust entertain the possibility of an indepen-\ndently evolved mechanism. Further-\nmore, unlike the best animal exam-\nples of putatively referential signals,\nmost of the words of human lan-\nguage are not associated with specif-\nic functions (e.g., warning cries, food\nannouncements) but can be linked to\nvirtually any concept that humans\ncan entertain. Such usages are often\nhighly intricate and detached from\nthe here and now. Even for the sim-\nplest words, there is typically no\nstraightforward word-thing relation-\nship, if “thing” is to be understood in\nmind-independent terms. Without\npursuing the matter here, it appears\nthat many of the elementary proper-\nties of words—including those that\nenter into referentiality—have only\nweak analogs or homologs in natural\nanimal communication systems, with\nonly slightly better evidence from the\ntraining studies with apes and dol-\nphins. Future research must therefore\nprovide stronger support for the pre-\ncursor position, or it must instead\nabandon this hypothesis, arguing that\nthis component of FLB (conceptual-\nintentional) is also uniquely human.\nDiscrete infinity and constraints\non learning. The data summarized thus far,\nalthough far from complete, provide overall\nsupport for the position of continuity between\nhumans and other animals in terms of FLB.\nHowever, we have not yet addressed one\nissue that many regard as lying at the heart of\nlanguage: its capacity for limitless expressive\npower, captured by the notion of discrete\ninfinity. It seems relatively clear, after nearly\na century of intensive research on animal\ncommunication, that no species other than\nhumans has a comparable capacity to recom-\nbine meaningful units into an unlimited vari-\nety of larger structures, each differing sys-\ntematically in meaning. However, little\nprogress has been made in identifying the\nspecific capabilities that are lacking in other\nanimals.\nFig. 5. Human and nonhuman animals exhibit the capacity to compute numerosities, including small precise\nnumber quantification and large approximate number estimation. Humans may be unique, however, in the ability\nto show open-ended, precise quantificational skills with large numbers, including the integer count list. In parallel\nwith the faculty of language, our capacity for number relies on a recursive computation.

A child is exposed to\nonly a small proportion of the possible sen-\ntences in its language, thus limiting its data-\nbase for constructing a more general version\nof that language in its own mind/brain. This\npoint has logical implications for any system\nthat attempts to acquire a natural language on\nthe basis of limited data. It is immediately\nobvious that given a finite array of data, there\nare infinitely many theories consistent with it\nbut inconsistent with one another. In the\npresent case, there are in principle infinitely\nmany target systems ( potential I-languages)\nconsistent with the data of experience, and\nunless the search space and acquisition mech-\nanisms are constrained, selection among\nthem is impossible. A version of the problem\nhas been formalized by Gold (100) and more\nrecently and rigorously explored by Nowak\nand colleagues (72–75). No known “general\nlearning mechanism” can acquire a natural\nlanguage solely on the basis of positive or\nnegative evidence, and the prospects for find-\ning any such domain-independent device\nseem rather dim. The difficulty of this prob-\nlem leads to the hypothesis that whatever\nsystem is responsible must be biased or con-\nstrained in certain ways. Such constraints\nhave historically been termed “innate dispo-\nsitions,” with those underlying language re-\nferred to as “universal grammar.” Although\nthese particular terms have been forcibly re-\njected by many researchers, and the nature of\nthe particular constraints on human (or ani-\nmal) learning mechanisms is currently unre-\nsolved, the existence of some such con-\nstraints cannot be seriously doubted. On the\nother hand, other constraints in animals must\nhave been overcome at some point in human\nevolution to account for our ability to acquire\nthe unlimited class of generative systems that\nincludes all natural languages. The nature of\nthese latter constraints has recently become\nthe target of empirical work. We focus here\non the nature of number representation and\nrule learning in nonhuman animals and hu-\nman infants, both of which can be investigat-\ned independently of communication and pro-\nvide hints as to the nature of the constraints\non FLN.\nMore than 50 years of research using clas-\nsical training studies demonstrates that ani-\nmals can represent number, with careful con-\ntrols for various important confounds (80). In\nthe typical experiment, a rat or pigeon is\ntrained to press a lever x number of times to\nobtain a food reward. Results show that ani-\nmals can hit the target number to within a\nclosely matched mean, with a standard devi-\nation that increases with magnitude: As the\ntarget number increases, so does variation\naround the mean. These results have led to\nthe idea that animals, including human in-\nfants and adults, can represent number ap-\nproximately as a magnitude with scalar vari-\nability (101, 102). Number discrimination is\nlimited in this system by Weber’s law, with\ngreater discriminability among small num-\nbers than among large numbers (keeping dis-\ntances between pairs constant) and between\nnumbers that are farther apart (e.g., 7 versus\n8 is harder than 7 versus 12). The approxi-\nmate number sense is accompanied by a sec-\nond precise mechanism that is limited to val-\nues less than 4 but accurately distinguishes 1\nfrom 2, 2 from 3, and 3 from 4; this second\nsystem appears to be recruited in the context\nof object tracking and is limited by working\nmemory constraints (103). Of direct rele-\nvance to the current discussion, animals can\nbe trained to understand the meaning of num-\nber words or Arabic numeral symbols. How-\never, these studies reveal striking differences\nin how animals and human children acquire\nthe integer list, and provide further evidence\nthat animals lack the capacity to create open-\nended generative systems.\nBoysen and Matsuzawa have trained\nchimpanzees to map the number of objects\nonto a single Arabic numeral, to correctly\norder such numerals in either an ascending or\ndescending list, and to indicate the sums of\ntwo numerals (104 –106). For example, Boy-\nsen shows that a chimpanzee seeing two or-\nanges placed in one box, and another two\noranges placed in a second box, will pick the\ncorrect sum of four out of a lineup of three\ncards, each with a different Arabic numeral.\nThe chimpanzees’ performance might sug-\ngest that their representation of number is like\nours. Closer inspection of how these chim-\npanzees acquired such competences, howev-\ner, indicates that the format and content of\ntheir number representations differ funda-\nmentally from those of human children. In\nparticular, these chimpanzees required thou-\nsands of training trials, and often years, to\nacquire the integer list up to nine, with no\nevidence of the kind of “aha” experience that\nall human children of approximately 3.5\nyears acquire (107). A human child who has\nacquired the numbers 1, 2, and 3 (and some-\ntimes 4) goes on to acquire all the others; he\nor she grasps the idea that the integer list is\nconstructed on the basis of the successor\nfunction. For the chimpanzees, in contrast,\neach number on the integer list required the\nsame amount of time to learn. In essence,\nalthough the chimpanzees’ understanding of\nArabic numerals is impressive, it parallels\ntheir understanding of other symbols and\ntheir referential properties: The system appar-\nently never takes on the open-ended genera-\ntive property of human language. This limi-\ntation may, however, reveal an interesting\nquirk of the child’s learning environment and\na difference from the training regime of ani-\nmals: Children typically first learn an arbi-\ntrary ordered list of symbols (“1, 2, 3, 4 . . . ”)\nand later learn the precise meaning of such\nwords; apes and parrots, in contrast, were\ntaught the meanings one by one without\nlearning the list. As Carey (103) has argued,\nthis may represent a fundamental difference\nin experience, a hypothesis that could be\ntested by first training animals with an arbi-\ntrary ordered list.\nA second possible limitation on the class\nof learnable structures concerns the kinds of\nstatistical inferences that animals can com-\npute. Early work in computational linguistics\n(108 –110) suggested that we can profitably\nthink about language as a system of rules\nplaced within a hierarchy of increasing com-\nplexity. At the lowest level of the hierarchy\nare rule systems that are limited to local\ndependencies, a subcategory of so-called\n“finite-state grammars.” Despite their attrac-\ntive simplicity, such rule systems are inade-\nquate to capture any human language. Natu-\nral languages go beyond purely local struc-\nture by including a capacity for recursive\nembedding of phrases within phrases, which\ncan lead to statistical regularities that are\nseparated by an arbitrary number of words or\nphrases. Such long-distance, hierarchical re-\nlationships are found in all natural languages\nfor which, at a minimum, a “phrase-structure\ngrammar” is necessary. It is a foundational\nobservation of modern generative linguistics\nthat, to capture a natural language, a grammar\nmust include such capabilities (Fig. 5).\nRecent studies suggest that the capacity to\ncompute transitional probabilities—an exam-\nple of a rule at the lowest level of the hierar-\nchy—might be available to human infants\nand provide a mechanism for segmenting\nwords from a continuous acoustic stream\n(111–113). Specifically, after familiarization\nto a continuous sequence of consonant-vowel\n(CV) syllables, where particular trigrams\n(three CVs in sequence, considered to be\n“words” in this context) have a high proba-\nbility of appearing within the corpus, infants\nare readily able to discriminate these tri-\ngrams from others that are uncommon.\nAlthough this ability may provide a mech-\nanism for word segmentation, it is appar-\nently not a mechanism that evolved unique-\nly in humans or for language: The same\ncomputation is spontaneously available to\nhuman infants for visual sequences and\ntonal melodies (113), as well as to nonhu-\nman primates (cotton-top tamarins) tested\nwith the same methods and stimuli (114 ).\nSimilarly, in the same way that human\ninfants appear capable of computing alge-\nbraic rules that operate over particular CV\nsequences (115), so too can cotton-top\ntamarins (116 ), again demonstrating that\nthe capacity to discover abstract rules at a\nS C I E N C E ’ S C O M P A S S\nwww.sciencemag.org SCIENCE VOL 29822 NOVEMBER 2002 1577\nlocal level is not unique to humans, and\nalmost certainly did not evolve specifically\nfor language.\nFitch and Hauser (117) recently complet-\ned a study comparing finite-state and phrase-\nstructure grammar acquisition in human\nadults and tamarins, using the same subjects\nand methods as the studies above. The\nphrase-structure rule tested was AnBn, where\nA and B were each represented by one of a\nset of eight different CVs. The rule therefore\nspecified both a set of consistent strings (n\nA’s must precede n B’s) and a set of incon-\nsistent strings; the latter consisted of viola-\ntions of order (B tokens precede A tokens) or\nof patterning (alternations of A’s and B’s\nsuch as ABAB). Results showed that human\nadults rapidly learned this rule implicitly,\ndistinguishing consistent and inconsistent\nstrings. Tamarins, in contrast, failed in three\nseparate experiments testing their ability to\nacquire this grammar, but they readily\nmastered a finite-state variant (ABn) imple-\nmented with the same stimuli and testing\nconditions. This suggests that tamarins have a\nlimited capacity to learn the type of long-\ndistance hierarchical dependencies necessary\nto achieve the class of phrase-structure gram-\nmars. If true, this limitation would place se-\nvere restrictions on their capacity to learn any\nnatural human language. It is currently un-\nclear whether this limitation generalizes to\nother animals, and whether it is similarly\nimposed on humans at different stages of\ndevelopment. Nonetheless, such experiments\nprovide an empirical approach to exploring\nkey differences between humans and animals\nrelevant to FLN.\nOur review has stressed the usefulness\nof animal data for theories about humans,\nbut this exchange need not be one-way. As\nthe research program we have sketched\nprogresses, more general principles about\ncognitive evolution may emerge. For exam-\nple, suppose we adopt the conception of\nhypothesis 3, oversimplifying radically,\nthat the interface systems—sensory-motor\nand conceptual-intentional—are given, and\nthe innovation that yielded the faculty of\nlanguage was the evolution of the compu-\ntational system that links them. The com-\nputational system must (i) construct an in-\nfinite array of internal expressions from the\nfinite resources of the conceptual-intention-\nal system, and (ii) provide the means to\nexternalize and interpret them at the senso-\nry-motor end. We may now ask to what\nextent the computational system is optimal,\nmeeting natural conditions of efficient\ncomputation such as minimal search and no\nbacktracking. To the extent that this can be\nestablished, we will be able to go beyond\nthe (extremely difficult, and still distant)\naccomplishment of finding the principles of\nthe faculty of language, to an understanding\nof why the faculty follows these particular\nprinciples and not others. We would then\nunderstand why languages of a certain class\nare attainable, whereas other imaginable\nlanguages are impossible to learn and sus-\ntain. Such progress would not only open the\ndoor to a greatly simplified and empirically\nmore tractable evolutionary approach to the\nfaculty of language, but might also be more\ngenerally applicable to domains beyond\nlanguage in a wide range of species—per-\nhaps especially in the domain of spatial\nnavigation and foraging, where problems of\noptimal search are relevant. For example,\nelegant studies of insects, birds, and pri-\nmates reveal that individuals often search\nfor food by an optimal strategy, one involv-\ning minimal distances, recall of locations\nsearched, and kinds of objects retrieved\n(77, 118, 119). Only after a concerted, mul-\ntidisciplinary attack on the problems of\nlanguage evolution, paralleling 40 years of\noptimal foraging research, will we learn\nwhether such similarities are more than\nsuperficial.\nConclusions\nWe conclude by making three points. First, a\npractical matter: Linguists and biologists,\nalong with researchers in the relevant branch-\nes of psychology and anthropology, can\nmove beyond unproductive theoretical debate\nto a more collaborative, empirically focused\nand comparative research program aimed at\nuncovering both shared (homologous or anal-\nogous) and unique components of the faculty\nof language. Second, although we have ar-\ngued that most if not all of FLB is shared with\nother species, whereas FLN may be unique to\nhumans, this represents a tentative, testable\nhypothesis in need of further empirical inves-\ntigation. Finally, we believe that a compara-\ntive approach is most likely to lead to new\ninsights about both shared and derived fea-\ntures, thereby generating new hypotheses\nconcerning the evolutionary forces that led to\nthe design of the faculty of language. Specif-\nically, although we have said relatively little\nabout the role of natural selection in shaping\nthe design features of FLN, we suggest that\nby considering the possibility that FLN\nevolved for reasons other than language, the\ncomparative door has been opened in a new\nand (we think) exciting way.\nComparative work has generally focused\non animal communication or the capacity to\nacquire a human-created language. If, how-\never, one entertains the hypothesis that recur-\nsion evolved to solve other computational\nproblems such as navigation, number quanti-\nfication, or social relationships, then it is\npossible that other animals have such abili-\nties, but our research efforts have been tar-\ngeted at an overly narrow search space (Fig.\n3). If we find evidence for recursion in ani-\nmals, but in a noncommunicative domain,\nthen we are more likely to pinpoint the mech-\nanisms underlying this ability and the selec-\ntive pressures that led to it. This discovery, in\nturn, would open the door to another suite of\npuzzles: Why did humans, but no other ani-\nmal, take the power of recursion to create an\nopen-ended and limitless system of commu-\nnication? Why does our system of recursion\noperate over a broader range of elements or\ninputs (e.g., numbers, words) than other ani-\nmals? One possibility, consistent with current\nthinking in the cognitive sciences, is that\nrecursion in animals represents a modular\nsystem designed for a particular function\n(e.g., navigation) and impenetrable with re-\nspect to other systems. During evolution, the\nmodular and highly domain-specific system\nof recursion may have become penetrable and\ndomain-general. This opened the way for hu-\nmans, perhaps uniquely, to apply the power\nof recursion to other problems. This change\nfrom domain-specific to domain-general may\nhave been guided by particular selective pres-\nsures, unique to our evolutionary past, or as a\nconsequence (by-product) of other kinds of\nneural reorganization. Either way, these are\ntestable hypotheses, a refrain that highlights\nthe importance of comparative approaches to\nthe faculty of language.\nReferences and Notes\n1. N.

Studying the genetics, evolution, and neurobiology of acoustic communication requires\nannotating acoustic signals: segmenting and identifying individual acoustic elements like syllables\nor sound pulses. To be useful, annotations need to be accurate, robust to noise, and fast.\nWe here introduce DeepAudioSegmenter (DAS), a method that annotates acoustic signals across\nspecies based on a deep-learning derived hierarchical presentation of sound. We demonstrate the\naccuracy, robustness, and speed of DAS using acoustic signals with diverse characteristics from\ninsects, birds, and mammals. DAS comes with a graphical user interface for annotating song,\ntraining the network, and for generating and proofreading annotations. The method can be trained\nto annotate signals from new species with little manual annotation and can be combined with\nunsupervised methods to discover novel signal types. DAS annotates song with high throughput\nand low latency for experimental interventions in realtime. Overall, DAS is a universal, versatile, and\naccessible tool for annotating acoustic communication signals.\nIntroduction\nAnimals produce sounds to foster group cohesion (Haack et al., 1983; Janik and Slater, 1998;\nChaverri et al., 2013), to signal the presence of food, friend, or foe (Ca¨sar et al., 2013; Clay et al.,\n2012), and to find and evaluate mating partners (Baker et al., 2019; Behr and von Helversen,\n2004; Holy and Guo, 2005; Sangiamo et al., 2020). Studying acoustic communication not only provides insight into social interactions within and across species; it can also reveal the mechanisms driving complex behaviors: The genetics and evolution of signal production and recognition (Ding et al.,\n2016), the genes and circuits driving song learning (Kollmorgen et al., 2020), or the fast and precise sensorimotor transformations involved in vocal interactions (Coen et al., 2016; Cator et al.,\n2009; Fortune et al., 2011; Okobi et al., 2019). The first step in many studies of acoustic communication is song annotation: the segmentation and labeling of individual elements in a recording.\nAcoustic signals are diverse and range from the repetitive long-distance calling songs of crickets,\ngrasshoppers, and anurans (Gerhardt and Huber, 2002), the dynamic and context-specific courtship\nsongs of vinegar flies or rodents (Coen et al., 2014; Clemens et al., 2018; Neunuebel et al., 2015;\nSangiamo et al., 2020), to the complex vocalizations produced by some birds and primates\n(Lipkind et al., 2013; Weiss et al., 2014; Landman et al., 2020).\nThis diversity in signal structure has spawned a zoo of annotation tools (Arthur et al., 2013;\nCoffey et al., 2019; Tachibana et al., 2020; Goffinet et al., 2021; Koumura and Okanoya, 2016;\nCohen et al., 2020), but existing methods still face challenges: First, assessing vocal repertoires and\nSteinfath et al. eLife 2021;10:e68837. DOI: https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.68837 1 of 25\nTOOLS AND RESOURCES\ntheir relation to behavioral and neural dynamics (Clemens et al., 2018; Coffey et al., 2019;\nNeunuebel et al., 2015; Fortune et al., 2011; Okobi et al., 2019) requires annotations to be complete and temporally precise even at low signal levels, but annotation can fail when signals are weak\n(Coffey et al., 2019; Stern et al., 2017). Second, analyses of large datasets and experimental interventions during behavior (Fortune et al., 2011; Okobi et al., 2019; Bath et al., 2014; Tschida and\nMooney, 2012; Stowers et al., 2017) need annotations to be fast, but existing methods are often\nslow. Last, annotation methods should be flexible and adaptable (Ding et al., 2016; Ding et al.,\n2019; Clemens et al., 2018; Clemens and Hennig, 2013), but existing methods often work only for\nrestricted types of signals or adapting them to new signals requires tedious manual tuning\n(Clemens et al., 2018).\nIn brief, an accurate, fast, and flexible framework for annotating song across species is missing. A\ngeneral framework would not only improve upon existing methods but would also facilitate the\nstudy of species for which automated methods do not yet exist. Deep neural networks have\nemerged as powerful and flexible tools for solving data annotation tasks relevant for neuroscience\nsuch as object recognition, pose tracking, or speech recognition (Krizhevsky et al., 2012;\nGraves and Jaitly, 2014; Mathis et al., 2018; Pereira et al., 2019; Graving et al., 2019). These\nmethods are not only fast and accurate but also easily adapted to novel signals by non-experts since\nthey only require annotated examples for learning. Recently, deep neural networks have also been\nused for annotating animal vocalizations (Oikarinen et al., 2019; Coffey et al., 2019; Cohen et al.,\n2020; Sainburg et al., 2020; Arthur et al., 2021; Goffinet et al., 2021).\nWe here present a new deep-learning-based framework for annotating acoustic signals, called\nDeep Audio Segmenter (DAS). We test the framework on a diverse set of recordings from insects,\nbirds, and mammals, and show that DAS annotates song in single- and multi-channel recordings\nwith high accuracy. The framework produces annotations with low latency on standard PCs and is\ntherefore ideally suited for closed-loop applications. Small-to-moderate amounts of manual annotations suffice for adapting the method to a new species and annotation work can be simplified by\ncombining DAS with unsupervised methods. We provide DAS as an open-source software package\nwith a graphical user interface for manually annotating audio, training the network, and inferring and\nproofreading annotations. Integration into existing frameworks for signal analysis or experimental\ncontrol is possible using a programmatic interface. The code and documentation for DAS are available at https://janclemenslab.org/das/.\nResults\nArchitecture and working principle of DAS\nAcoustic signals are defined by features on multiple timescales—the fast harmonic oscillations of the\nsound carrier (<10 ms), modulations of amplitude (AM) and frequency (FM) (10–100 ms), and the\nsequencing of different AM and FM patterns into bouts, syllables, or phrases (10–1000 ms). These\npatterns are typically made explicit using a hand-tuned pre-processing step based on time-resolved\nFourier or wavelet transforms (Arthur et al., 2013; Van Segbroeck et al., 2017; Coffey et al.,\n2019; Oikarinen et al., 2019; Cohen et al., 2020). Most deep-learning-based methods then treat\nthis pre-defined spectrogram as an image and use methods derived from computer vision to extract\nthe AM and FM features relevant for annotation (Oikarinen et al., 2019; Coffey et al., 2019;\nCohen et al., 2020). Recurrent units are sometimes used to track the sound features over time\n(Cohen et al., 2020). This approach can produce accurate annotations but has drawbacks: First, the\nspectrogram constitutes a strong and proven pre-processing step, but it is unsuitable for some signal types, like short pulsatile signals. Second, the pre-processing transform is typically tuned by hand\nand may therefore require expert knowledge for it to produce optimal results. Lastly, the recurrent\nunits used in some methods (Cohen et al., 2020) excel at combining information over time to provide the context information necessary to annotate spectrally complex signals, but they can be hard\nto train and slow to run (Bai et al., 2018).\nDAS solves these limitations in three ways: First, the pre-processing step is optional. This makes\nDAS more flexible, since signals for which a time-resolved Fourier transform is not appropriate—for\ninstance, short pulsatile signals—can now also be processed. Second, the optional preprocessing\nstep is integrated and optimized with the rest of the network. This removes the need to hand-tune\nSteinfath et al. eLife 2021;10:e68837. DOI: https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.68837 2 of 25\nTools and resources Neuroscience\nthis step and allows the network to learn a preprocessing that deviates from a time-resolved Fourier\nor wavelet transform if beneficial (Choi et al., 2017). Integrating the preprocessing into the network\nalso increases inference speed due to the efficient implementation and hardware acceleration of\ndeep-learning frameworks. Third and last, DAS learns a task-specific representation of sound features using temporal convolutional networks (TCNs) (Bai et al., 2018; van den Oord et al., 2016;\nGuirguis et al., 2021; Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–E). At the core of TCNs are so-called\ndilated convolutions (Yu and Koltun, 2016). In standard convolutions, short templates slide over the\nsignal and return the similarity with the signal at every time point. In dilated convolutions, these templates have gaps, allowing to analyze features on longer timescales without requiring more parameters to specify the template. Stacking dilated convolutions with growing gap sizes results in a\nhierarchical, multi-scale representation of sound features, which is ideally suited for the hierarchical\nand harmonic structure of animal vocalizations.\nThe output of the deep neural network in DAS is a set of confidence scores for each audio sample, corresponding to the probability of each song type (Figure 1C). Annotation labels for the different song types are mutually exclusive and are produced by comparing the confidence score to a\nthreshold or by choosing the most probable song type. Brief gaps in the annotations are closed and\nshort spurious detections are removed to smoothen the annotation. For song types that are\ndescribed as events, like the pulses in fly song (Figure 1A), the event times are extracted as local\nmaxima that exceed a confidence threshold.\nDAS accurately annotates song from a diverse range of species\nFly courtship song\nWe first tested DAS on the courtship song of Drosophila melanogaster, which consists of two major\nmodes (Figure 1A): The sine song, which corresponds to sustained oscillations with a species-specific carrier frequency (150 Hz), and two types of pulse song, which consists of trains of short (5–10\nms) pulses with carrier frequencies between 180 and 500 Hz, produced with a species-specific interval (35–45 ms in D. melanogaster). Males dynamically choose the song modes based on sensory\nfeedback from the female (Coen et al., 2014; Clemens et al., 2018; Calhoun et al., 2019). Despite\nthe relative simplicity of the individual song elements, an accurate annotation of fly song is challenging because of low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR): The song attenuates rapidly with distance (BennetClark, 1998) and is highly directional (Morley et al., 2018), which can lead to weak signals if the\nmale is far from the microphone (Figure 1A). Moreover, the interactions between the flies introduce\npulsatile noise and complicate the accurate and complete annotation of the pulse song.\nWe first trained DAS to detect the pulse and the sine song recorded using a single microphone\n(data from Stern, 2014) and compared the performance of DAS to that of the current state-of-theart in fly song segmentation, FlySongSegmenter (FSS) (Arthur et al., 2013; Coen et al., 2014;\nClemens et al., 2018). Annotation performance was quantified using precision, the fraction of correct detections, and recall, the fraction of true song that is detected (Figure 1E,J, Figure 1—figure\nsupplement 1F,G). We counted detected pulses within 10 ms of a true pulse as correct detections.\nTen ms corresponds to 1/4th of the typical interval between pulses in a train and results are robust\nto the choice of this value (Figure 1—figure supplement 2A). DAS detects pulses with a high precision of 97% - only 3% of all detected pulses are false detections - and a high recall of 96% - it misses\nonly 4% of all pulses. This is a substantial improvement in recall over FSS, which has slightly higher\nprecision (99%) but misses 13% of all pulses (87% recall) (Figure 1D,E). In DAS, the balance between\nprecision and recall can be controlled via the confidence threshold, which corresponds to the minimal confidence required for labeling a pulse (Figure 1C): Lowering this threshold from 0.7 to 0.5\nyields a recall of 99% for pulse song with a modest reduction in precision to 95%. The performance\ngain of DAS over FSS for pulse stems from better recall at high frequencies (>400 Hz) and low SNR\n(Figure 1G,H). To assess DAS performance for sine song, we evaluated the sample-wise precision\nand recall. DAS has similar precision to FSS (92% vs 91%) but higher recall (98% vs. 91%) (Figure 1I,\nJ). Recall is higher in particular for short sine songs (<100 ms) and at low SNR (<1.0) (Figure 1L,M).\nThe performance boost for pulse and sine arises because DAS exploits context information, similar\nto how humans annotate song: For instance, DAS discriminates soft song pulses from pulsatile noise\nbased on the pulse shape but also because song pulses occur in regular trains while noise pulses do\nnot (Figure 1—figure supplement 2C). A comparison of DAS’ performance to that of human\nSteinfath et al. eLife 2021;10:e68837.

Performance for multi-channel recordings of fly courtship song.\nSteinfath et al. eLife 2021;10:e68837. DOI: https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.68837 4 of 25\nTools and resources Neuroscience\nannotators reveals that our methods exceeds human-level performance for pulse and sine\n(Figure 1E,J, Table 1).\nTemporally precise annotations are crucial, for instance when mapping sensorimotor transformations based on the timing of behavioral or neuronal responses relative to individual song elements\n(Coen et al., 2014; Srivastava et al., 2017; Long and Fee, 2008; Benichov and Vallentin, 2020).\nWe therefore quantified the temporal error of the annotations produced by DAS. For pulse song,\nthe temporal error was taken as the distance of each pulse annotated by DAS to the nearest true\npulse. The median temporal error for pulse is 0.3 ms which is negligible compared to the average\nduration of a pulse (5–10 ms) or of a pulse interval (35–45 ms) (Deutsch et al., 2019). For sine song,\nthe median temporal error for on- and offsets was 12 ms, which is almost half of that of FSS (22 ms).\nSine song can have low SNR (Figure 1M) and fades in and out, making the precise identification of\nsine song boundaries difficult even for experienced manual annotators (see Figure 1A,C).\nRecording song during naturalistic interactions in large behavioral chambers often requires multiple microphones (Coen et al., 2014; Neunuebel et al., 2015). To demonstrate that DAS can process\nmulti-channel audio, we trained DAS to annotate recordings from a chamber tiled with nine microphones (Coen et al., 2014; Figure 1—figure supplement 3, Figure 1—figure supplement 1B).\nDAS processes multi-channel audio by using filters that take into account information from all channels simultaneously. As is the case for existing methods (Arthur et al., 2013), we achieved maximal\nperformance by training separate networks for the pulse and for the sine song (Table 2). In multichannel recordings, DAS annotates pulse song with 98% precision and 94% recall, and sine song\nwith 97% precision and 93% recall, and matches the performance of FSS (FSS pulse precision/recall\n99/92%, sine 95/93%) (Figure 1—figure supplement 3D–L). Annotations of multi-channel audio\nhave high temporal precision for pulse (DAS 0.3 ms, FSS 0.1 ms) and sine (DAS 8 ms, FSS 15 ms)\n(Figure 1—figure supplement 3E,J). Overall, DAS performs better or as well as the current state-ofthe-art method for annotating single and multi-channel recordings of fly song.\nMouse ultrasonic vocalizations\nMice produce ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) in diverse social contexts ranging from courtship to\naggression (Sangiamo et al., 2020; Warren et al., 2020; Neunuebel et al., 2015). We tested DAS\nusing audio from an intruder assay, in which an anesthetized female was put into the home cage and\nthe USVs produced by a resident female or male were recorded (Ivanenko et al., 2020). The female\nUSVs from this assay typically consist of pure tones with weak harmonics and smooth frequency\nmodulations that are often interrupted by frequency steps (Figure 2A,B). The male USVs are similar\nbut also contain complex frequency modulations not produced by the females in this assay\n(Figure 2C,D). Recording noise from animal movement and interaction as well as the frequency\nsteps often challenge spectral threshold-based annotation methods and tend to produce false positive syllables (Tachibana et al., 2020; Coffey et al., 2019). Moreover, weak signals often lead to\nmissed syllables or imprecisely delimited syllables. We first trained and tested DAS on recordings of\na female mouse interacting with an anesthetized female intruder (Figure 2A). DAS annotates the\nfemale USVs with excellent precision (98%) and recall (99%) (Figure 2E) and low median temporal\nerror (0.3 ms) (Figure 2F). DAS is robust to noise: Even for weak signals (SNR 1/16) the recall is 90%\n(Figure 2G). These performance values are on par with that of methods specialized to annotate\nUSVs (Tachibana et al., 2020; Coffey et al., 2019; Van Segbroeck et al., 2017) (see Table 3). USVs\nof female and male residents have similar characteristics (Figure 2A,B) and the female-trained DAS\nnetwork also accurately annotated the male vocalizations (Figure 2H). Notably, even the male\nTable 1.

Performance for marmoset vocalizations.\nSteinfath et al. eLife 2021;10:e68837. DOI: https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.68837 6 of 25\nTools and resources Neuroscience\nMarmoset vocalizations\nWe next examined the robustness of annotations produced by DAS to noisy recordings and variable\nvocalization types, by training a network to annotate vocalization from pairs of marmosets\n(Landman et al., 2020). The recordings contain lots of background noises like faint calls from nearby\nanimals, overdrive from very loud calls of the recorded animals, and large variability within syllable\ntypes (Figure 2—figure supplement 1A–D). Recently, a deep-learning-based method was shown to\nproduce good performance (recall 77%, precision 85%, 12.5 ms temporal error) when trained on\n16,000 syllables to recognize seven vocalization types (Oikarinen et al., 2019). We trained DAS on\n1/9th of the data (1800 syllables) containing four of the seven vocalization types. Despite the noisy\nand variable vocalizations, DAS achieves high syllable-wise precision and recall (96%, 92%, (Figure 2—figure supplement 1E,F)). Note that DAS obtains this higher performance at millisecond resolution (temporal error 4.4 ms, Figure 2—figure supplement 1G), while the method by\nOikarinen et al., 2019 only produces annotations with a resolution of 50 ms (Table 2).\nBird song\nBird song is highly diverse and can consist of large, individual-specific repertoires. The spectral complexity and large diversity of the song complicates the annotation of syllable types. Traditionally, syllable types are annotated based on statistics derived from the segmented syllable spectrogram.\nRecently, good annotation performance has been achieved with unsupervised methods\n(Sainburg et al., 2020; Goffinet et al., 2021) and deep neural networks (Koumura and Okanoya,\n2016; Cohen et al., 2020). We first trained DAS to annotate the song from four male Bengalese\nfinches (data and annotations from Nicholson et al., 2017). The network was then tested on a random subset of the recordings from all four individuals which contained 37 of the 48 syllable types\nfrom the training set (Figure 3A,B, Figure 3—figure supplement 1A,B). DAS annotates the bird\nsong with high accuracy: Sample-wise precision and recall are 97% and syllable on- and offsets are\ndetected with sub-millisecond precision (median temporal error 0.3 ms, Figure 3C). The types of\n98.5% the syllables are correctly annotated, with only 0.3% false positives (noise annotated as a syllable), 0.2% false negatives (syllables annotated as noise), and 1% type confusions (Figure 3D, Figure 3—figure supplement 1C–D). This results in a low sequence error (corresponding to the\nminimal number of substitutions, deletions, or insertions required to transform the true sequence of\nsyllables into the inferred one) of 0.012. Overall, DAS performs as well as specialized deep-learningbased methods for annotating bird song (Koumura and Okanoya, 2016; Cohen et al.,\n2020, Table 2).\nTable 3. Comparison to alternative methods.\nMethods used for comparisons: (1) Arthur et al., 2013, (2) Tachibana et al., 2020, (3) Oikarinen et al., 2019, (4) Cohen et al., 2020.\n(A,B) DAS was trained on 1825/15970 syllables which contained 4/7 of the call types from Oikarinen et al., 2019. (B) The method by\nOikarinen et al., 2019 produces an annotation every 50 ms of the recording - since the on/offset can occur anywhere within the\n50 ms, the expected error of the method by Oikarinen et al., 2019 is at least 12.5 ms. (C) The method by Oikarinen et al., 2019\nannotates 60 minutes of recordings in 8 minutes.

DOI: https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.68837 7 of 25\nTools and resources Neuroscience\nTo further demonstrate the robustness of DAS, we trained a network to annotate song from\nZebra finches. In Zebra finch males, individual renditions of a given syllable type tend to be more\nvariable (Fitch et al., 2002). Moreover, the particular recordings used here (Goffinet et al., 2021)\ncontain background noise from the bird’s movement. Despite the variability and noise, DAS annotates the six syllables from a male’s main motif with excellent precision and recall, and low temporal\nerror, demonstrating that DAS is robust to song variability and recording noise (Figure 3—figure\nsupplement 2).\nIn summary, DAS accurately and robustly annotates a wide range of signals—from the pulsatile\nsong pulses of flies to the spectrally complex syllables of mammals and birds. DAS therefore constitutes a universal method for annotating acoustic signals that is as good as or better than methods\nspecialized for particular types of signals (Table 2).\nDAS is fast\nTo efficiently process large corpora of recordings and to be suitable for closed-loop applications,\nDAS needs to infer annotations quickly. We therefore assessed the throughput and latency of DAS.\nThroughput measures the rate at which DAS annotates song and high throughput means that large\ndatasets are processed quickly. Across the five species tested here, DAS has a throughput of 8-82x\nrealtime on a CPU and of 24-267x on a GPU (Figure 4A). This means that a 60 min recording is\nannotated in less than five minutes on a standard desktop PC and in less than 1.5 minutes using a\nGPU, making the annotation of large datasets feasible (Figure 4—figure supplement 1A–H). The\ndifferences in throughput arise from the different sample rates and network architectures: The marmoset network is fastest because of a relatively shallow architecture with only 2 TCN blocks and a\nlow sampling rate (44.1 kHz). By contrast, the multi-channel Drosophila networks have the lowest\nthroughput because of multi-channel inputs (9 channels at 10.0 kHz) and a comparatively deep architecture with four TCN blocks (Table 4).\nA\n0.1 s\n0.5\n1.0\n2.0\n4.0\n8.0\nFrequency [kHz]\nB\nC\nDAS\nManual\n0 20\nDAS\n0\n10\n20\n30\nManual\n0 1 2 3 4\nTemporal error [ms]\n0.0\n1.0\n2.0\nPDF\nD\nSong\nNo song\n%\n-70\n0\ndB\n0.1\n1\n10\n100\nFigure 3.

Throughput is >8x realtime on a CPU (dark shades) and >24x or more on a GPU\n(light shades). Latency (B) corresponds to the time it takes to annotate a single chunk of audio and is similar on a CPU (dark shades) and a GPU (light\nshades). Multi-channel audio from flies was processed using separate networks for pulse and sine. For estimating latency of fly song annotations, we\nused networks with 25 ms chunks, not the 410 ms chunks used in the original network (see Figure 1—figure supplement 2).

DOI: https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.68837 9 of 25\nTools and resources Neuroscience\nA measure of speed crucial for closed-loop experiments is latency, which quantifies the time it\ntakes to annotate a chunk of song and determines the delay for experimental feedback. Latencies\nare short, between 7 and 15 ms (Figure 4B, Figure 4—figure supplement 1I–P) on CPUs and\nGPUs. One network parameter impacting latency is the chunk size—the duration of audio processed\nat once—and we find that for fly song, latency can be optimized by reducing chunk size with a minimal impact on accuracy (Figure 4—figure supplement 2). The low latency of annotation makes DAS\nwell suited for triggering realtime optogenetic or acoustic feedback upon the detection of specific\nvocalizations (Bath et al., 2014; Stowers et al., 2017).\nWe also compared the speed of DAS to that of other methods that were specifically developed\nto annotate the types of signals tested here. Since most existing methods are not suitable for estimating latency due to constraints in their design and interface, we only compared throughput. We\nfind that DAS achieves 3x to 10x higher throughput than existing methods (Table 2). This has three\nmain reasons: First, the relatively simple, purely convolutional architecture exploits the parallel processing capabilities of modern CPUs and GPUs. Second, Fourier or wavelet-like preprocessing steps\nare integrated into the network and profit from a fast implementation and hardware acceleration.\nThird, for multi-channel data, DAS combines information from all audio channels early, which\nincreases throughput by reducing the data bandwidth.\nOverall, DAS annotates audio with high throughput (>8x realtime) and low latency (<15 ms) and\nis faster than the alternative methods tested here. The high speed renders DAS suitable for annotating large corpora and for realtime applications without requiring specialized hardware.\nDAS requires little manual annotation\nTo be practical, DAS should achieve high performance with little manual annotation effort. We find\nthat DAS can be efficiently trained using an iterative protocol (Pereira et al., 2019, Figure 4C, Figure 4—figure supplement 4): Annotate a small set of recordings and train the network for a few\nepochs; then generate annotations on a larger set of recordings and correct these annotations.\nRepeat the predict-correct-train cycle on ever larger datasets until performance is satisfactory. To\nestimate the amount of manual annotations required to achieve high performance, we evaluated\nDAS trained on subsets of the full training data sets used above (Figure 4—figure supplement 3).\nWe then took the number of manual annotations needed to reach 90% of the performance of DAS\ntrained on the full data sets as an upper bound on the data requirements (Figure 4D). With a performance threshold of 90%, the resulting networks will produce sufficiently accurate annotations for\ncreating a larger body of training data with few corrections. Performance was taken as the F1 score,\nthe geometric mean of precision and recall. For single-channel recordings of fly song, fewer than 50\npulses and 20 sine songs are needed to reach 90% of the performance achieved with the full data\nset. For mouse vocalizations, DAS achieves 90% of its peak performance with fewer than 25 manually\nannotated syllables. Even for the six syllables from a zebra finch, DAS reaches the 90% threshold\nwith only 48 manually annotated syllables (eight per type). Manually annotating such small amounts\nof song for flies, mice, or zebra finches takes less than 5 min. Likewise, for the song of Bengalese\nfinches, 1–51 (median 8, mean 17) manual annotations are required per syllable type, with one outlier requiring 200 syllables (Figure 4—figure supplement 3C). Closer inspection reveals that the outlier results from an annotation error and consists of a mixture of three distinct syllable types\n(Figure 4—figure supplement 3D–F). Even with this outlier, only 626 manually annotated syllabes\n(424 without) are required in total to reach 90% of the test performance of a network trained on\n>3000 annotated syllables. Data requirements are higher for the multi-channel recordings of fly song\n(270 pulses and sine songs), and for the noisy and variable marmoset data (1610 annotations, 400\nper type), but even in these cases, the iterative training protocol can reduce the manual annotation\nwork.\nOverall, DAS requires small to moderate amounts of data for reaching high performance. High\nthroughput (Figure 4A) and small training data sets (Figure 4D) translate to short training times\n(Figure 4E). The single-channel data sets typically achieve 90% of the performance after less than 10\nmin of training on a GPU. Training on the full data sets typically finishes in fewer than five hours.\nThus, DAS can be adapted to novel species in short time and with little manual annotation work.\nSteinfath et al. eLife 2021;10:e68837. DOI: https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.68837 10 of 25\nTools and resources Neuroscience\nDAS can be combined with unsupervised methods\nDAS is a supervised annotation method: It discriminates syllable types that have been manually\nassigned different labels during training. By contrast, unsupervised methods can determine in unlabelled data whether syllables fall into distinct types and if so, classify the syllables (Tabler et al.,\n2017; Coffey et al., 2019; Clemens et al., 2018; Goffinet et al., 2021; Sainburg et al., 2020;\nSangiamo et al., 2020; Arthur et al., 2021). While DAS does not require large amounts of manual\nannotations (Figure 4D), manual labeling of syllable types can be tedious when differences between\nsyllable types are subtle (Clemens et al., 2018) or when repertoires are large (Sangiamo et al.,\n2020). In these cases, combining DAS with unsupervised methods facilitates annotation work. To\ndemonstrate the power of this approach, we use common procedures for unsupervised classification,\nwhich consist of an initial preprocessing (e.g. into spectograms) and normalization (e.g. of amplitude)\nof the syllables, followed by dimensionality reduction and clustering (see Materials and methods)\n(Clemens et al., 2018; Sainburg et al., 2020; Sangiamo et al., 2020).\nFor fly song, DAS was trained to discriminate two major song modes, pulse and sine. However,\nDrosophila melanogaster males produce two distinct pulse types, termed Pslow and\nPfast (Clemens et al., 2018), and unsupervised classification robustly discriminates the two pulse\ntypes as well as the sine song in the DAS annotations (Figure 5A–C). Mouse USVs do not fall into\ndistinct types (Tabler et al., 2017; Goffinet et al., 2021; Sainburg et al., 2020). In this case, unsupervised clustering produces a low-dimensional representation that groups the syllables by the similarity of their spectrograms (Tabler et al., 2017; Coffey et al., 2019; Sangiamo et al., 2020,\nFigure 5D,E). For marmosets, unsupervised classification recovers the four manually defined call\ntypes (Figure 5F,G). However, most call types are split into multiple clusters, and the clusters for\ntrills and twitters tend to separate poorly (Figure 4—figure supplement 3G), which reflects the\nlarge variability of the marmoset vocalizations. This contrasts with the song of Zebra finches, for\nwhich the unsupervised method produces a one-to-one mapping between manually defined and\nunsupervised syllable types (Goffinet et al., 2021; Sainburg et al., 2020; Figure 5H,I). For the song\nof Bengalese finches, the unsupervised classification recovers the manual labeling (Goffinet et al.,\n2021; Sainburg et al., 2020; Figure 5J,K) and reveals manual annotation errors: For instance, the\nsong syllable that required >200 manual annotations to be annotated correctly by DAS is a mixture\nof three distinct syllable types (Figure 4—figure supplement 3C–F).\nOverall, unsupervised methods simplify annotation work: DAS can be trained using annotations\nthat do not discriminate between syllable types and the types can be determined post hoc. If distinct\ntypes have been established, DAS can be retrained to directly annotate these types using the labels\nproduced by the unsupervised method as training data.\nDiscussion\nWe here present Deep Audio Segmenter (DAS), a method for annotating acoustic signals. DAS\nannotates song in single- and multi-channel recordings from flies (Figure 1, Figure 1—figure supplement 3), mammals ( Figure 2, Figure 2—figure supplement 1), and birds (Figs Figure 3, Figure 3—figure supplement 2) accurately, robustly, and quickly (Figure 4A,B). DAS performs as well\nas or better than existing methods that were designed for specific types of vocalizations\n(Koumura and Okanoya, 2016; Cohen et al., 2020; Tachibana et al., 2020; Coffey et al., 2019,\nTable 2). DAS performs excellently for signals recorded on single and multiple channels (Figure 1,\nFigure 1—figure supplement 3), with different noise levels, and with diverse characteristics. This\nsuggests that DAS is a general method for accurately annotating signals from a wide range of\nrecording setups and species.\nUsing a user-friendly graphical interface, our method can be optimized for new species without\nrequiring expert knowledge and with little manual annotation work (Figure 4C–E). Network performance is robust to changes in the structural parameters of the network, like filter number and duration, or the network depth (Figure 4—figure supplement 5). Thus, the structural parameters do not\nneed to be finely tuned to obtain a performant network for a new species. We have trained networks\nusing a wide range of signal types (Table 4) and these networks constitute good starting points for\nadapting DAS to novel species. We provide additional advice for the design of novel networks in\nMethods. This makes the automatic annotation and analysis of large corpora of recordings from\ndiverse species widely accessible.\nSteinfath et al. eLife 2021;10:e68837. DOI: https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.68837 11 of 25\nTools and resources Neuroscience\nWe show that the annotation burden can be further reduced using unsupervised classification of\nsyllable types, in particular for species with large or individual-specific repertoires (Figure 5,\nClemens et al., 2018; Tabler et al., 2017; Coffey et al., 2019; Goffinet et al., 2021;\nSainburg et al., 2020; Arthur et al., 2021). In the future, incorporating recent advances in the selfsupervised or semi-supervised training of neural networks will likely further reduce data requirements\n(Mathis et al., 2021; Raghu et al., 2019; Devlin et al., 2019; Chen and He, 2020). These\napproaches use unlabeled data to produce networks with a general and rich representation of sound\nfeatures that can then be fine-tuned for particular species or individuals using few annotated samples. DAS currently does not work well with recordings in which the signals produced by multiple\nanimals overlap. In the future, DAS will be extended with methods for multi-speaker speech recognition to robustly annotate vocalizations from animal groups.\nLastly, the high inference speed (Figure 4A,B) allows integration of DAS in closed-loop systems\nin which song is detected and stimulus playback or optogenetic manipulation is triggered with low\nlatency (Bath et al., 2014; Stowers et al., 2017). In combination with realtime pose tracking\n(Mathis et al., 2018; Pereira et al., 2019; Graving et al., 2019), DAS provides unique opportunities\nto tailor optogenetic manipulations to specific behavioral contexts, for instance to dissect the neural\ncircuits underlying acoustic communication in interacting animals (Coen et al., 2014; Fortune et al.,\n2011; Okobi et al., 2019).\nA\nSine\nPslow\nPfast\nB\nC\n4 ms\nJ\nK\nD\nE\nH\nI\n0.5\n8.0kHz\n0.1 s\n-70\n-10\ndB\nek\ntwitter tsik\ntrill\nF\nG\nek\ntwitter\ntsik\ntrill\nFigure 5.

Most types split into multiple clusters, reflecting\nthe variability of the call types in marmosets. Colored bars on top of each spectrogram in G correspond to the colors for the individual clusters in F.\nThe dashed line shows the boundary separating trills and twitters. (H, I) Low-dimensional representation of the spectrograms of the syllables from one\nZebra finch male, mean spectrogram for each cluster in H (I, top), and example of each clustered syllable within the motif (I, bottom). Density-based\nclustering (colors) recovers the six syllable types forming the male’s motif. Colored bars on top of each spectrogram in I correspond to the colors for\nthe individual clusters in H. (J, K) Low-dimensional representation of the spectrograms of the syllables from four Bengalese finch males (J) and mean\nspectrogram for each cluster in J (K). Syllables separate into distinct types and density-based clustering (colors) produces a classification of syllables\nthat closely matches the manual annotations (homogeneity score 0.96, completeness score 0.89, v-score 0.92). X-axes of the average spectrograms for\neach cluster do not correspond to linear time, since the spectrograms of individual syllables were temporally log-rescaled and padded prior to\nclustering. This was done to reduce the impact of differences in duration between syllables.\nSteinfath et al. eLife 2021;10:e68837.

Code for\nthe das python module is available at https://github.com/janclemenslab/das, code for the unsupervised methods is at https://github.com/janclemenslab/das_unsupervised. All fitted models (with\nexample data and code) can be found at https://github.com/janclemenslab/das-menagerie.\nWe also provide instructions for training DAS using google colab, which provides a GPU-accelerated python environment. Colab removes the need to install GPU libraries: Annotations can be\nmade locally in the GUI without a GPU and training and prediction are done on GPU-accelerated\nnodes in the cloud. See this notebook for details: http://janclemenslab.org/das/tutorials/colab.html.\nData sources\nAll data used for testing DAS were published previously. Sources for the original data sets, for the\ndata and annotations used for training and testing, and for the fitted models are listed in Table 5.\nSingle-channel recordings of Drosophila melanogaster (strain OregonR) males courting females were\ntaken from Stern, 2014. The multi-channel data from Drosophila melanogaster (strain NM91) males\ncourting females were recorded in a chamber tiled with nine microphones (Coen et al., 2014) and\nwas previously published in Clemens et al., 2018. Annotations for fly song were seeded with FlySongSegmenter (Arthur et al., 2013; Coen et al., 2014) and then manually corrected. Recordings\nof mouse USVs were previously published in Ivanenko et al., 2020. The USVs were manually labeled\nusing the DAS graphical interface. Marmoset recordings were taken from the data published with\nLandman et al., 2020. Since we required more precise delineation of the syllable boundaries than\nwas provided in the published annotations, we manually fixed annotations for a subset of the data\nthat then was used for training and testing. The network was trained and tested on a subset of four\nvocalization types (eks/trills/tsiks/twitters, N=603/828/115/868). The remaining vocalization types\nwere excluded since they had 60 or fewer instances in our subset. To test DAS on bird songs, we\nused a publicly available, hand-labeled collection of song from four male Bengalese finches\nTable 5.

For training and testing the Zebra finch network, we manually labeled 473 syllables of six types (320 s of recordings).\nDAS network\nDAS is implemented in Keras (Chollet, 2015) and Tensorflow (Abadi et al., 2016). At its core, DAS\nconsists of a stack of temporal convolutional blocks, which transform an input sequence of audio\ndata into an output sequence of labels.\nInputs\nDAS takes as input raw, single or multi-channel audio. Pre-processing of the audio using a wavelet\nor short-time Fourier transform (STFT) is optional and integrated into the network. DAS processes\naudio in overlapping chunks (Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–D). The chunking accelerates annotations since multiple samples are annotated in a single computational step. Edge effects are\navoided by processing overlapping chunks and by discarding a number of samples at the chunk\nboundaries. The overlap depends on the number of layers and the duration of filters in the network.\nSTFT frontend\nThe trainable STFT frontend is an optional step and was implemented using kapre (Choi et al.,\n2017). Each frequency channel in the output of the frontend is the result of two, one-dimensional\nstrided convolutions which are initialized with the real and the imaginary part of discrete Fourier\ntransform kernels:\nxði;fÞ ¼XT1\nt ¼0\nxði  sþ t Þ½cosð2pf t =TÞ isinð2pf t =TÞ\nyði;fÞ ¼ log10ð\nffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi\n<xði;fÞ\n2 þ =xði;fÞ\n2\nq\nÞ\nwhere f is the frequency, s is the stride, and T is the filter duration. The stride results in downsampling of the input by a factor s.\nThe STFT kernels are optimized with all other parameters of the network during training. The\nSTFT frontend was used for mammal and bird signals, but not for fly song. In the mammal and bird\nnetworks, we used 33 STFT filter pairs with a duration T ¼ 64 samples and a stride s ¼ 16 samples.\nFor mouse and bird song, the STFT frontend sped up training and inference, and had a small positive impact on performance. For fly song, the STFT frontend tended to reduce performance and was\nomitted.\nTemporal convolutional blocks\nTemporal convolutional network (TCN) blocks are central to DAS and produce a task-optimized hierarchical representation of sound features at high temporal resolution (Bai et al., 2018). Each TCN\nblock consists of a stack of so-called residual blocks (Figure 1—figure supplement 1E, He et al.,\n2016):\nA dilated convolutional layer filters the input with a number of kernels of a given duration:\nyiðtÞ ¼ P\nt ;g\nkiðt ; gÞ  xðt  at ; gÞ, where kiðt ; gÞ is the i th kernel, xðt; gÞ is the input on channel g at\ntime t, yiðtÞ the output, and a the gap or skip size (Yu and Koltun, 2016). In old-fashioned convolution a ¼ 1. Increasing a allows the kernel to span a larger range of inputs with the same number of\nparameters and without a loss of output resolution. The number of parameters is further reduced for\nnetworks processing multi-channel audio, by using separable dilated convolutions in the first two\nTCN blocks (Mamalet and Garcia, 2012). In separable convolutions, the full two-dimensional kðt ; gÞ\nconvolution over times and channels is decomposed into two one-dimensional convolutions. First, a\ntemporal convolution, k\nt\nðt ; 1Þ, is applied to each channel and then N channel convolutions, k\ng\nð1; gÞ,\ncombine information across channels. Instead of t  g parameters, the separable convolution only\nrequires t þ N  g parameters. Note that each temporal convolution is applied to each channel,\nleading to a sharing of filter parameters across channels. This makes explicit the intuition that some\nSteinfath et al. eLife 2021;10:e68837. DOI: https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.68837 14 of 25\nTools and resources Neuroscience\noperations should be applied to all channels equally. We also tested an alternative implementation,\nin which individual channels were first processed separately by a single-channel TCN, the outputs of\nthe TCN blocks for each channel were concatenated, and then fed into a stack of standard TCNs\nwith full two-dimensional convolutions. While this architecture slightly increased performance it was\nalso much slower and we therefore chose the architecture with separable convolutions. Architecture\nchoice ultimately depends on speed and performance requirements of the annotation task.\nA rectifying linear unit transmits only the positive inputs from the dilated convolutional layer by\nsetting all negative inputs to 0: yi ¼ maxð0; yiÞ.\nA normalization layer rescales the inputs to have a maximum absolute value close to 1:\nyi=ðmaxðjyi\njÞ þ 105\nÞ.\nThe output of the residual block, zðtÞ, is then routed to two targets: First, it is added to the input:\noðtÞ ¼ xðtÞ þ zðtÞ and fed into subsequent layers. Second, via so-called skip connections, the outputs\nof all residual blocks are linearly combined to produce the network’s final output (van den Oord\net al., 2016).\nA single TCN block is composed of a stack of five residual blocks. Within a stack, the skip size a\ndoubles - from one in the first to 2\n5 ¼ 16 in the final residual block of a stack. This exponential\nincrease in the span of the filter t  a allows the TCN block to produce a hierarchical representation\nof its inputs, from relatively low-level features on short timescales in early stacks to more derived features on longer timescales in late stacks. Finally, a full network consists of a stack of 2 to 4 TCN\nblocks, which extract ever more derived features (Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–D).\nOutput\nThe network returns a set of confidence scores—one for each song type (and for ’no song’)—for\neach sample from a linear combination of the output of each residual block in the network, by using\na single dense layer and a softmax activation function. Re-using information from all blocks via socalled skip connections ensures that downstream layers can discard information from upstream\nlayers and facilitates the generation of specialized higher order presentations. If the input recording\ngot downsampled by a STFT frontend, a final upsampling layer restores the confidence scores to the\noriginal audio rate by repeating values. The parameters of all used networks are listed in Table 4.\nChoice of structural network parameters\nDAS performance is relatively robust to the choice of structural network parameters like filter duration and number, or network depth (Figure 4—figure supplement 5). The networks tested here are\ngood starting points for adapting DAS to your own data (Table 4). In our experience, a network with\n32 filters, filter duration 32 samples, 3 TCN blocks, and a chunk duration of 2048 samples will produce good results for most signals. A STFT downsampling layer with 32 frequency bands and 16x\ndownsampling should be included for most signals except when the signals have a pulsatile character. These parameters have been set as defaults when creating a new DAS network. Given that DAS\ntrains quickly (Figure 4E), network structure can be optimized by training DAS networks over a grid\nof structural parameters, for instance to find the simplest network (in terms of the number of filters\nand TCN blocks) that saturates performance but has the shortest latency. We here provide additional guidelines for choosing a network’s key structural parameters:\nThe chunk duration corresponds to the length of audio the network processes in one step and\nconstitutes an upper bound for the context available to the network. Choose chunks sufficiently long\nso that the network has access to key features of your signal. For instance, for fly song, we ensured\nthat a single chunk encompasses several pulses in a train, so the network can learn to detect song\npulses based on their regular occurrence in trains. Longer chunks relative to this timescale can\nreduce short false positive detections, for instance for fly sine song and for bird song. Given that\nincreasing chunk duration does not increase the number of parameters for training, we recommend\nusing long chunks unless low latency is of essence (see below).\nDownsampling/STFT weakly affects performance but strongly accelerates convergence during\ntraining. This is because (A) the initialization with STFT filters is a good prior that reduces the number\nof epochs it takes to learn the optimal filters, and (B) the downsampling reduces the data bandwidth\nand thereby the time it takes to finish one training epoch. The overall increase in performance from\nadding the STFT layer is low because convolutional layers in the rest of the network can easily\nSteinfath et al. eLife 2021;10:e68837. DOI: https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.68837 15 of 25\nTools and resources Neuroscience\nreplicate the computations of the STFT layer. For short pulsatile signals or signals with low sampling\nrates, STFT and downsampling should be avoided since they can decrease performance due to the\nloss of temporal resolution.\nThe number of TCN blocks controls the network’s depth. A deeper network can extract more\nhigh-level features, though we found that even for the spectro-temporally complex song of Bengalese finches, deeper networks only weakly improved performance (Figure 4—figure supplement 5).\nMulti-channel audio can be processed with multi-channel filters via full convolutions or with\nshared channel-wise filters via time-channel separable convolutions. This can be set on a per-TCNblock basis. We recommend to use separable convolutions in the first 1–2 layers, since basic feature\nextraction is typically the same for each channel. Later layers can then have full multi-channel filters\nto allow more complex combination of information across channels.\nReal-time performance can be optimized by reducing networks complexity and chunk duration\n(Figure 4—figure supplement 2). We recommend starting with the default parameters suggested\nabove and then benchmarking latency. If required, latency can then be further reduced by reducing\nchunk duration, the number and duration of filters, and the number of TCN blocks.\nTraining\nNetworks were trained using the categorical cross-entropy loss and the Adam optimizer\n(Kingma and Ba, 2015) with a batch size of 32. Prediction targets were generated from fully annotated recordings and one-hot-encoded: Segments were coded as binary vectors, with yiðtÞ ¼ 1 if a\nsegment of type i occurred at time t, and yiðtÞ ¼ 0 otherwise. To encode uncertainty in the timing of\nfly song pulses, the pulses were represented as Gaussian bumps with a standard deviation of\n1.6 ms. A ’no song’ type was set to ynosongðtÞ ¼ 1\nP\ni\nyiðtÞ. That way, y corresponds to the probability of finding any of the annotated song types or no song. For bird song, short gaps (6.25 ms, 200\nsamples at 32 kHz) were introduced between adjacent syllables to aid the detection of syllable onand offsets after inference. That way, syllable on- and offsets could be unequivocally detected as\nchanges from ‘no song’ to any of the syllables. This reduced the amount of false positive on- and offsets from switches in the inferred label within a syllable.\nTypically, multiple fully annotated recordings were combined in a data set. Each recording was\nsplit 80:10:10 into a training, validation, and test set. The validation and test data were randomly\ntaken from the first, the middle or the last 10% of each recording. Given the uneven temporal distribution of call types in the marmoset recordings, we split the data 60:20:20 to ensure that each call\ntype was well represented in each split. For all networks, training was set to stop after 400 epochs\nor earlier if the validation loss was not reduced for at least 20 epochs. Training typically stopped\nwithin 40–80 epochs depending on the dataset. The test set was only used after training, for evaluating the model performance.\nGeneration of annotations from the network output\nThe confidence scores produced by the model correspond to the sample-wise probability for each\nsong type. To produce an annotation label for each sample, the confidence scores were further\nprocessed to extract event times and syllable segments. In the resulting annotations, song types are\nmutually exclusive, that is, each sample is labeled as containing a single song type even if song types\noverlap.\nEvent times for event-like song types like fly pulse song were determined based on local maxima\nin the confidence score, by setting a threshold value between 0 and 1 and a minimal distance\nbetween subsequent peaks (using peakutils, Negri and Vestri, 2017). For the pulse song of flies,\nwe set a minimal distance of 10 ms and a threshold of 0.7 for single channel data (Figure 1) and 0.5\nfor multi-channel data (Figure 1—figure supplement 3).\nFor segment-like song types like fly sine song or the syllables of mouse, marmoset, and bird\nsong, we first transformed the sample-wise probability into a sequence of labels using argmaxi\nyði; tÞ.\nThe resulting annotation of segments was then smoothed by filling short gaps (flies 20 ms, mice 10\nms, marmosets and birds 5 ms) and removing very short detections (flies 20 ms, mice 5 ms, marmosets and birds 30 ms). These values were chosen based on the statistics of song found in the training\ndata. Syllable on- and offsets were detected as changes from no-song to song and song to no-song,\nSteinfath et al. eLife 2021;10:e68837. DOI: https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.68837 16 of 25\nTools and resources Neuroscience\nrespectively. For bird and marmoset vocalizations, syllable labels were determined based on a\nmajority vote, by calculating the mode of the sample-wise labels for each detected syllable.\nEvaluation\nDAS was evaluated on segments of recordings that were not used during training.\nEvents\nFor events—fly pulse song, or the on- and offsets of segments—we matched each true event with its\nnearest neighbor in the list of true events and counted as true positives only events within a specified distance from a true event. For the pulse song of flies as well as for the onsets and offsets of\nmouse, marmoset, and bird syllables, this distance was set to 10 ms. Results were robust to the specific choice of the distance threshold (Figure 1—figure supplement 2A). For the onsets and offsets\nof fly sine song and of the marmoset vocalizations, we set this distance to 40 ms, since these signals\ntended to fade in and out, making the delineation of exact boundaries difficult. False positive events\nwere counted if the distance from a detected event to the nearest true event exceeded the distance\nthreshold or if another detected event was closer to each true event within the distance threshold. If\nseveral detected pulses shared the same nearest true pulses, only the nearest of those was taken as\na true positive, while the remaining detections were matched with other true pulses within the distance threshold or counted as false positives.\nFalse negatives were counted as all true events without nearby detected events. For pulse,\npseudo true negative events were estimated as the number of tolerance distances (2x tolerance distance) fitting into the recording, minus the number of pulses. These true negatives for pulse do not\ninfluence precision, recall, and F1-scores and are only used to fill the confusion matrices in\nFigure 1D,I and Figure 1—figure supplement 3C,H. Pulse and sine song were evaluated only up to\nthe time of copulation.\nMatching segment labels\nFor songs with only one syllable type, we compared the predicted and true labels for each sample\nto compute the confusion matrix (Figure 1—figure supplement 1F,G). In the case of multiple syllable types, the mode of the true and predicted labels for the samples of each detected syllable were\ncompared. A true positive was counted if the mode of the true labels was the same for the samples\ncovered by the detected syllable. Using the true syllables as reference produces similar results (Figure 2—figure supplement 1E,F and Figure 3—figure supplement 1D,E).\nPerformance scores\nFrom the false negative (FN), false positive (FP), and true positive (TP) counts we extracted several\nscores: Precision (P)—the fraction of true positive out of all detections TP/(FP+TP)—and recall (R)—\nthe fraction of true positives out of all positives TP/(TP+FN). The F1 score combines precision and\nrecall via their geometric mean: 2  P  R=ðP þ RÞ. For datasets with many different syllable types,\nwe also used as a summary measure of performance the accuracy—the fraction of correctly labelled\nsyllables: (TP+TN)/(TP+TN+FP+FN). For comparison with other studies, we additionally provide the\nerror rate for the song of Bengalese finches, which is based on the Levenshtein edit distance and\ncorresponds to the minimal number of inserts, deletions, and substitutions required to transform the\nsequence of true syllable labels into the sequence of predicted syllable labels normalized by the\nlength of the true sequence (Koumura and Okanoya, 2016; Cohen et al., 2020).\nTemporal precision\nThe temporal precision for events (pulses, syllable onsets and offsets) was calculated as the median\nabsolute distance between all matched events.\nAnnotation errors for Bengalese finches\nThe network for annotating bird song was trained on all syllable types. We removed from the test\ndata one syllable type with only a single instance in the test set (which was correctly classified),\nbecause the performance could not be assessed reliably based on a single instance. We also\nexcluded as annotation error a syllable type that contained syllables of more than six distinct types.\nSteinfath et al. eLife 2021;10:e68837. DOI: https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.68837 17 of 25\nTools and resources Neuroscience\nEstimation of signal-to-noise ratio from audio recordings\nTo assess the robustness of annotation performance to noise, we assessed the recall of DAS for\nepochs with different signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) for the fly and the mouse networks. Because of\nfundamental differences in the nature of the signals, SNR values were computed with different methods and are therefore not directly comparable across species.\nPulse\nPulse waveforms were 20 ms long and centered on the peak of the pulse energy. The root-mean\nsquare (RMS) amplitudes of the waveform margins (first and last 5 ms) and center (7.5–12.5 ms) were\ntaken as noise and signal, respectively. RMS is defined as\nffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi P\ni\nxðiÞ\n2\nq\n. For multi-channel recordings,\nthe pulse waveform from the channel with the highest center RMS was chosen to calculate the SNR.\nSine\nSignal was given by the RMS amplitudes of the recording during sine song. Noise is the RMS amplitude in the 200 ms before and after each sine song, with a 10 ms buffer. For instance, if a sine song\nended at 1000 ms, the recording between 1010 and 1210 ms was taken as noise. From the 200 ms\nof noise, we excluded samples that were labeled as sine or pulse and included intervals between\npulses. For multi-channel recordings, the SNR was calculated for the channel with the largest signal\namplitude.\nMouse\nWe assumed an additive noise model: s\n2\ntotal ¼ s\n2\nsignal þ s\n2\nnoise is the squared signal averaged over a\nwindow of 1 ms. Since noise variance changed little relative to the signal variance in our recordings,\nwe can assume constant noise over time to calculate the signal strength: s\n2\nsignal ¼ s\n2\ntotal\nP\nt s\n2\nnoise.\nThe sample-wise SNR is then given by SNRðtÞ ¼ ssignalðtÞ\n2\n=\nP\nt s\n2\nnoise.\nSpeed benchmarks\nInference speed was assessed using throughput and latency. Throughput is the number of samples\nannotated per second and latency is the time it takes to annotate a single chunk. Throughput and\nlatency depend on the chunk duration—the duration of a recording snippet processed by the network at once—and on the batch size—the number of chunks processed during one call. Larger\nbatches maximize throughput by more effectively exploiting parallel computation in modern CPUs\nand GPUs and reducing overheads from data transfer to the GPU. This comes at the cost of higher\nlatency, since results are available only after all chunks in a batch have been processed. Using small\nbatch sizes and short chunks therefore reduces latency, since results are available earlier, but this\ncomes at the cost of reduced throughput because of overhead from data transfer or under-utilized\nparallel compute resources. To assess throughput and latency, run times of model.predict were\nassessed for batch sizes ranging from 1 to 1024 (log spaced) with 10 repetitions for each batch size\nafter an initial warmup run (Figure 4—figure supplement 1A–L). Results shown in the main text are\nfrom a batch size corresponding to 1 s of recording for throughput (Figure 4A) and a batch size of 1\nfor latency (Figure 4B, see also Figure 4—figure supplement 1). For fly song, latency was optimized\nby reducing the chunk size to 25.6 ms (Figure 4—figure supplement 2). Benchmarks were run on\nWindows 10, Tensorflow 2.1, with the network either running on a CPU (Intel i7-7770, 3.6 GHz) or on\na GPU (GTX1050 Ti 4 GB RAM).\nWe also benchmarked the throughput of existing methods for comparison with DAS (Table 2).\nSince neither of the methods considered are designed to be used in ways in which latency can be\nfairly compared to that of DAS, we did not assess latency. The throughput values include all preprocessing steps (like calculation of a spectrogram) and comparisons to DAS were done using the\nsame hardware (CPU for FSS and USVSEG, GPU for TweetyNet and Oikarinen et al., 2019). The\nthroughput of FSS (Arthur et al., 2013; Coen et al., 2014) was tested using 400 s of single-channel\nand 9-channel recordings in Matlab2019a. USVSEG Tachibana et al., 2020 was tested on a 72 s\nrecording in Matlab2019a. TweetyNet (Cohen et al., 2020) was tested using a set of 4 recordings\n(total duration 35 s). Throughput for TweetyNet was given by the combined runtimes of the preprocessing steps (calculating of spectrograms from raw audio and saving them as temporary files)\nSteinfath et al. eLife 2021;10:e68837. DOI: https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.68837 18 of 25\nTools and resources Neuroscience\nand the inference steps (running the network on a GPU). For the previously published network for\nannotating marmoset calls (Oikarinen et al., 2019), we relied on published values for estimating\nthroughput: A processing time of 8 min for a 60 min recording corresponds to a throughput of 7.5\ns/s.\nData economy\nFor estimating the number of manual annotations required to obtain accurate annotations, we\ntrained the networks using different fractions of the full training and validation sets (for instance,\n0.001, 0.005, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1.0). Performance of all networks trained on the different subsets\nwas evaluated on the full test sets. The number of manual annotations in each subset was determined after training from the training and validation sets. The number of annotations required to\nexceed 90% of the F1 score of a model trained on the full data sets was calculated based on a lowess fit (Cleveland, 1979) to the data points (Figure 4A,B).\nUnsupervised classification\nSegmented signals were clustered using unsupervised methods described previously in\nClemens et al., 2018, Sainburg et al., 2020, and Sangiamo et al., 2020. First, signals were preprocessed: For fly song, pulse and sine waveforms of duration 15 ms were extracted from the\nrecording, aligned to their peak energy, normalized to unit norm, and adjusted for sign (see\nClemens et al., 2018 for details). For mouse, marmoset, and bird vocalizations, we adapted the procedures described in Sainburg et al., 2020: Noise was reduced in the bird song recordings using\nthe noisereduce package (https://github.com/timsainb/noisereduce). For mouse and marmoset\nvocalizations, noise reduction tended to blur the spectral contours and was omitted. Then, syllable\nspectrograms were extracted from mel spectrograms of the recordings. The noise floor of the spectrogram at each frequency was estimated as the median spectrogram over time and each spectral\nband was then divided by the frequency-specific noise floor value. Finally, the spectrogram values\nwere log-transformed and thresholded at zero for mice and two for marmosets and birds after visual\ninspection of the spectrograms to further remove background noise. To reduce differences in the\nduration of different syllables, all syllables were first log resized in time (scaling factor 8) and then\npadded with zeros to the duration of the longest syllable in the data set. Lastly, the frequency axis\nof the spectrograms for mouse syllables were aligned to the peak frequency, to make clustering\nrobust to jitter in the frequency of the thin spectral contours (Sangiamo et al., 2020). The peak frequency of each mouse syllable was calculated from its time-averaged spectrogram, and only the 40\nspectrogram frequencies around the peak frequency were retained.\nThe dimensionality of the pre-processed waveforms (fly) or spectrograms (mouse, marmoset,\nbirds) was then reduced to two using the UMAP method (McInnes and Healy, 2018) (mindistX= 0.5, 0.1 for marmosets to improve separation of clusters). Finally, signals were grouped using\nunsupervised clustering. For the fly, marmoset, and bird signals, the UMAP distribution revealed distinct groups of syllables and we used a density-based method to cluster the syllables\n(Campello et al., 2013, min_samplesX= 10, min_cluster_sizeX= 20). For mouse USVs, no clusters were visible in the UMAP distribution and density-based clustering failed to identify distinct\ngroups of syllables. Syllables were therefore split into 40 groups using k-means clustering.\nOpen source software used\n. avgn https://github.com/timsainb/avgn_paper Sainburg et al., 2020\n. hdbscan McInnes et al., 2017\n. ipython Perez and Granger, 2007\n. jupyter Kluyver et al., 2016\n. kapre Choi et al., 2017\n. keras Chollet, 2015\n. keras-tcn https://github.com/philipperemy/keras-tcn\n. librosa McFee et al., 2015\n. matplotlib Hunter, 2007\n. noisereduce https://github.com/timsainb/noisereduce\n. numpy Harris et al., 2020\n. pandas McKinney, 2010\nSteinfath et al. eLife 2021;10:e68837.

Klump2*\nBioacoustic research spans a wide range of biological questions and applications, relying on\nidentification of target species or smaller acoustic units, such as distinct call types. However, manually\nidentifying the signal of interest is time-intensive, error-prone, and becomes unfeasible with large\ndata volumes. Therefore, machine-driven algorithms are increasingly applied to various bioacoustic\nsignal identification challenges. Nevertheless, biologists still have major difficulties trying to transfer\nexisting animal- and/or scenario-related machine learning approaches to their specific animal datasets\nand scientific questions. This study presents an animal-independent, open-source deep learning\nframework, along with a detailed user guide. Three signal identification tasks, commonly encountered\nin bioacoustics research, were investigated: (1) target signal vs. background noise detection, (2)\nspecies classification, and (3) call type categorization. ANIMAL-SPOT successfully segmented humanannotated target signals in data volumes representing 10 distinct animal species and 1 additional\ngenus, resulting in a mean test accuracy of 97.9%, together with an average area under the ROC\ncurve (AUC) of 95.9%, when predicting on unseen recordings. Moreover, an average segmentation\naccuracy and F1-score of 95.4% was achieved on the publicly available BirdVox-Full-Night data corpus.\nIn addition, multi-class species and call type classification resulted in 96.6% and 92.7% accuracy on\nunseen test data, as well as 95.2% and 88.4% regarding previous animal-specific machine-based\ndetection excerpts. Furthermore, an Unweighted Average Recall (UAR) of 89.3% outperformed the\nmulti-species classification baseline system of the ComParE 2021 Primate Sub-Challenge. Besides\nanimal independence, ANIMAL-SPOT does not rely on expert knowledge or special computing\nresources, thereby making deep-learning-based bioacoustic signal identification accessible to a broad\naudience.\nIn order to gain deeper insights and a better understanding about animal communication, it is imperative to\nidentify vocalization prototypes, derive linguistic patterns, and correlate acoustic paradigms with corresponding\nbehavioral observations. Therefore, it is mandatory to perform in-depth data analysis of large-scale bioacoustic\nOPEN\n1\nPattern Recognition Lab, Department of Computer Science, Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg,\n91058 Erlangen, Germany. 2\nCognitive and Cultural Ecology Lab, Max Planck Institute of Animal Behavior,\n78315 Radolfzell, Germany. 3\nDepartment of Human Behavior, Ecology and Culture, Max Planck Institute\nfor Evolutionary Anthropology, 04103 Leipzig, Germany. 4\nBiology Department, University of Konstanz,\n78464 Constance, Germany. 5\nDepartment of Natural Resources and Environmental Sciences, University of Illinois\nUrbana-Champaign, Champaign, IL, United States. 6\nMax Planck Institute for Biological Intelligence, in Foundation,\nSeewiesen Eberhard-Gwinner-Strasse, 82319 Starnberg, Germany. 7\nDepartment of Anthropology, University of\nVictoria, Victoria, BC V8P 5C2, Canada. 8\nLeibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research, Alfred‑Kowalke‑Straße\n17, 10315 Berlin, Germany. 9\nDepartment of Bioscience, Wildlife Ecology, Aarhus University, 8410 Rønde,\nDenmark. 10Department of Vertebrate Ecology and Zoology, Faculty of Biology, University of Gdańsk,\n80‑308 Gdańsk, Poland. 11Department of Bioscience, Marine Mammal Research, Aarhus University, 4000 Roskilde,\nDenmark. 12Department of Biology, University of Southern Denmark, 5230 Odense, Denmark. *email:\nchristian.bergler@fau.de; bklump@ab.mpg.de\n2\nVol:.(1234567890)\nScientific Reports | (2022) 12:21966 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-26429-y\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\ndata archives in order to draw statistically significant and representative hypotheses regarding the vocal repertoire of a particular species. Passive Acoustic Monitoring (PAM) concepts1–3\n are widely used to acquire massive\nbioacoustic data collections4–7\n, without affecting the natural animal habitats8\n and thus significantly increase the\nprobability to observe all natural communicative patterns, following the observer’s paradox principle9\n. Furthermore, PAM-based approaches strongly benefit from decreasing costs for recording equipment and data\nstorage10–13, combined with recent technological advances14–20. However, time- and human-resource restrictions prohibit a profound and comprehensive manual data analysis. Consequently, machine (deep) learning\napproaches are increasingly applied in bioacoustic research21,22 and have shown to be a productive avenue to\nidentify target animal species (e.g., marine mammals23–26, birds27,28, bats29, mosquitos30), smaller acoustic units\nsuch as call types (e.g., bird call types27,31) and group-level differences within target animal species (e.g., killer\nwhale pods32). Despite a growing deployment of various machine (deep) learning techniques in the field of bioacoustics, essential research tasks such as target species identification and call type classification still prove to\nbe extremely difficult and challenging.\nMachine (deep) learning approaches are often designed for a particular animal species and lack data-related\nmodel adaption and hyperparameter fine-tuning options. In addition, the software and/or source code is often\nnot publicly available, combined with missing or insufficient user guidelines which describe required data preparation, network training setup, and model evaluation. It thereby often precludes not just a general transfer to\nanimal- and user-specific research questions, but mainly prevents non-computer science operators to train their\nown use-case and animal-specific models, which in turn significantly hampers progress in research on animal\ncommunication. In this study, we introduce ANIMAL-SPOT, an open-source machine learning framework that\nenables biologists to independently train and evaluate animal-specific deep learning-based classification models\nin order to address fundamental biological research questions, including target/noise detection and/or species/\ncall type identification.\nThree typical scenarios present themselves when attempting to identify the vocalizations of a target species\nor individual: (1) The target signal appears without confounding factors such as other similar vocalizations\nand the task is to determine the target signal with respect to background noise, (2) the target signal appears in\nconjunction with other, dissimilar, species-specific vocalizations and the signal of interest must be distinguished\nbetween other bioacoustic signals and background noise, and (3) the target signal appears with other signals,\nsome of which share similar properties to the target vocalizations and the model must differentiate between\nsimilar signals, dissimilar signals, as well as background noise. The approach described here allows a researcher\nto address all of these tasks, with slight differences in data structure as well as usage of the trained models.\nA detailed user guide33, provided in conjunction with this work which describes the data setup as well as\nmodel configuration, allows users to create and apply models with no prior deep learning knowledge. The core\ndeep learning workflow took inspiration from ORCA-SPOT34, a ResNet-1835-based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), originally designed for segmenting killer whale (Orcinus orca) vocalizations from environmental\nbackground noise. ANIMAL-SPOT has been adapted and extended to become an animal-independent deep\nlearning framework, evaluating bioacoustic target versus environmental noise detection for 10 species-specific\ndata volumes and 1 additional genus-based dataset, next to the publicly available BirdVox-Full-Night36 repository. In addition, multi-species classification has been performed in two different scenarios: (1) as a downstream\nprocess, using previously machine-detected and extracted genus-specific target signals, and (2) as a stand-alone\nprocedure, analyzing the Computational Paralinguistics Challenge Primate (ComParE-PRS)37,38 multi-species\ndata volume. Moreover, multi-class call type classification has been exemplarily conducted for a single species,\nusing the same downstream approach. The ANIMAL-SPOT workflow is generalizable, enabling unparalleled\nflexibility in processing task- and animal-specific bioacoustic data corpora. Figure 1 visualizes all animal speciesspecific spectrograms (10 different species, 1 additional genus), representing a single vocalization event.\nIn summary, ANIMAL-SPOT provides a publicly-available animal-independent bioacoustic machine learning\nenvironment, which allows scientists, regardless of their technical backgrounds, to train and evaluate speciesspecific deep neural networks, supported by detailed user guidelines, in order to answer fundamental biological\nresearch questions (target/sound detection, species classification, and call type recognition). To the best of the\nauthors’ knowledge, this is the first study presenting an animal-independent and publicly-available deep learning framework, evaluated across many bioacoustic signal identification scenarios. As input data, we use many\nannotated datasets from a broad range of animal species and provide evaluation results using these as well as\npublicly available species detection and classification challenge data corpora.\nMaterials and methods\nBioacoustic signal identification and classification scenarios. Signal identification can be performed at different levels: (1) taxonomic group (e.g., all birds), (2) species (e.g., monk parakeet), or (3) call type\n(e.g., contact call). The level highly influences data preparation and classification complexity. Raising taxonomic\nspecialization simultaneously leads to an increase of the labeled data granularity being required for an adequate\nnetwork training. Furthermore, classification intricacy grows with the level of taxonomic detail. The network\nhas to learn and derive features, being robust against all potential types of environmental noise as well as other\nanimal sounds, except the signals of interest, including within-species variation. The level of taxonomy also\naffects the amount of chosen network output classes—binary detection (e.g., delphinidae vs. noise) or multi-class\nclassification (killer whale vs. white-sided dolphin vs. bottlenose dolphin vs. noise)—which in turn impacts classification complexity. An adequate identification scenario is therefore determined by the biological use-case and\ntaxonomic depth, in combination with the available data material, recorded via active/passive acoustic monitoring. Regarding the animal corpora, two initial data material situations are possible: (1) dataset only contains\nbackground noise and target signals, or (2) dataset includes background noise, target signals, and other vocaliza-\n3\nVol.:(0123456789)\nScientific Reports | (2022) 12:21966 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-26429-y\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\ntions that often resemble the target signal. Consequently, the following classification procedures are conceivable:\n(1) binary target/noise detection—isolating environmental noise from the taxonomic-dependent animal signals\naccording to the above mentioned data scenarios, or (2) multi-class species/call type recognition—classifying\nbetween multiple target species or call types, combined with the illustrated potential data situations. To ensure\na robust, animal-independent identification procedure, a binary target/noise detection at the desired taxonomic\nlevel (e.g., animal genus) has to be conducted first, to remove noise and other irrelevant animal vocalizations\nin advance. Taxonomic depth leads to an increasing spectral closeness between signals being represented in the\nnoise class, which results in less distinctive network features separating both classes. Depending on the initial\nmodel performance for the chosen taxonomic rank, target/noise data distribution might be restructured with\nrespect to a higher, more generic taxonomic level (e.g. genus to order-level). Based on the respective detection\nresult, subsequent multi-class classification can be conducted with respect to more specific taxonomic ranks,\nsuch as animal species (e.g., Blue-winged vs. Golden-winged warbler) or different call types (e.g., monk parakeet\nalarm, contact, and other calls), ending up in a multi-stage classification procedure. ANIMAL-SPOT is also\ncapable of performing recognition with respect to different species-specific regional differences (dialects) as well\nas individual identification. Sufficient representative data for dialects of interest or individual-specific vocalizations, in the same way as for the other multi-class classification problems described here, is the only precluding\nfactor. Filtering away noise and other animal vocalizations via the two-step approach enables focus on analysis\nof regional differences (dialects) and acoustic identification of individuals. Instructions on model configuration\nand necessary data structure will be further detailed in the user guide33 with examples.\nAnimal species and recording setup. In order to show and prove animal independence, 10 different\nspecies and 1 additional genus within the chordate phylum were chosen. The overall goal was to test model\nrobustness for as many different habitat types (urban parks, marine reserve, arctic landice), frequency ranges\n(30 Hz for Atlantic cod to 100,000 Hz for Pygmy pipistrelle), vocalization durations (echolocation sweeps in ms\nto long roars of multiple seconds), signal-to-noise ratios (urban parks versus noise isolated laboratory), noise\ncharacteristics (underwater noise, human narrations, other species), as well as recording setups (passive acoustic\nmonitoring—e.g., Harbour seals—versus focal follows—e.g., Blue-/Golden-winged warblers). A detailed summary regarding all animal-specific recording and data collection setups, utilized within this study, is given in\nSupplementary Table S1.\nBioacoustic data material. No animals were approached for this study specifically but rather all data used\nwere collected by distinct research teams under their own ethics guidelines. In case of binary detection, each\nspecies/genus target and noise was manually annotated. The target class contained only vocalizations produced\nby the target species/genus (see Table 1). In cases where further sub-classification was envisioned (species level\nFigure 1.  Animal-specific data (10 different species, 1 additional genus) utilized to investigate the ANIMALSPOT framework (created via Inkscape39, Version 0.92.3).\n4\nVol:.(1234567890)\nScientific Reports | (2022) 12:21966 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-26429-y\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\nfor the two warblers—Table 2, call type level regarding monk parakeets—Table 3), these were labeled as well,\nbut all assigned to the target class. The noise class included all other sound segments, such as environmental/\nbackground noise, human narrations, and other animal sounds. While both the number of annotated segments\nand the class distribution differed for each species, the ratio between vocalization and noise ranges from ≈20%\nup to ≈57% for all listed data archives. To perform embedded noise augmentation, additional noise segments\nwere provided for some of the species (see Table 1). ANIMAL-SPOT was trained and evaluated in three different experiments: (1) detection between target and noise to separate noise from valuable animal signals, and (2)\nmulti-class species classification, and (3) multi-class call type identification.

These were additionally used to\nvalidate model performance. In order to prove detection accuracy even further, an additional publicly-available\ndataset was utilized—the BirdVox-Full-Night data archive—presented by Lostanlen et al.36 for the evaluation\nof approaches designed to detect avian flight calls (see Table 1, last row). The original dataset consists of 9.8 h\nof audio, recorded by six sensors placed in the area around Ithaca, New York, which were manually annotated\nresulting in 35,402 500 ms-long flight calls of nocturnally migrating birds of about 25 species of passerines.\nTo balance the dataset an equal number of 500-ms-long noise samples were added to the dataset, resulting in\n70,804 files (see Table 1, last row). Regarding the BirdVox-Full-Night archive, there were no additional unseen\nrecordings, compared to the remaining data repositories listed in Table 1. Multi-class species classification was\nconducted between Blue-winged and Golden-winged warbler (see Table  2). In addition the Computational\nParalinguistics Challenge Primate (ComParE-PRS)37,38 dataset was used to distinguish between four different\nprimate species (see Table 4). The dataset includes over 10,000 annotated vocalizations from Chimpanzees (Pan\ntroglodytes), Mandrills (Mandrillus sphinx), Red-capped mangabeys (Cercocebus torquatus), and a mixed group\nof Guenons (Cercopithecus spp.). Additionally, exactly the same number of noise samples as vocalizations were\nextracted to make up the noise class38. Multi-class call type classification was computed for three main call type\nclasses of monk parakeet vocalizations including alarm, contact, and other calls, listed in Table 3. Across all\nmulti-class scenarios, the existing target class repertoire was extended by an additional noise category to simulate real-world scenarios, as well as cover and handle potential false alarms caused within the first detection stage\n(see Supplementary Figs. S5 and S6).\nDeep learning concepts and network architectures. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) were\nutilized in order to identify animal vocalizations of interest. A CNN is an end-to-end deep learning architecture\nbased on the principles of pattern recognition including a feature learning and classification component being\nable to efficiently process the complexity of 2-dimensional input data (e.g., images, spectrograms)34,40,41. Convolutional layers are responsible for feature learning, while the classification part is done by the fully connected\nlayers40. Convolutional layers embed and represent the following important concepts34,40: (1) local receptive\nfields, (2) shared weights, and (3) subsampling (pooling). Due to the fact that convolutional and pooling layers only compute linear operations, CNNs integrate activation layers (e.g., Rectified Linear Unit34,42) as well as\nnormalization layers (e.g., batch normalization34,43) to handle the non-linearity within the data and to ensure a\nmore stabilized and regularized training procedure34. Several repetitive sequentially ordered sequences of convolutional, pooling, normalization, and activation layers lead to extracted and learned features which are used as\ninput for the fully-connected layer projecting the features on the respective output classes34. The core concept of\nthe presented deep learning framework is based on a so-called Residual Network (ResNet)35. A ResNet is a network architecture, which is built up from different concatenated residual layers35. A residual layer is constructed\nfrom an arrangement of building blocks which in turn consist of weight (e.g., convolutional, fully-connected),\nnormalization (e.g. batch-norm43), and activation layers (e.g., ReLU42), as well as residual-/skip-connections.\nDue to this residual-/skip-connection technique it is possible to learn a residual mapping F(x) = H(x) − x\ninstead of a direct underlying mapping H(x) for a given input x35, enabling to counteract the accuracy degradation problem (accuracy decrease after saturation region, by further increasing network depth, compared to shallower versions of the network35) and training deeper nets. Different numbers and structures of building blocks\nresult in various ResNet architectures. Well known and established ResNet models are ResNet18, ResNet34,\nResNet50, ResNet101, and ResNet15235. For more detailed insights about residual learning/networks see He\net al.35.\nANIMAL–SPOT. The deep learning framework consists of a ResNet18-based CNN, derived from ORCASPOT34, our previous killer whale deep detection model, which has been adapted and extended to handle all\nkinds of vocalizing animals. The initial max-pooling layer within the traditional ResNet18 architecture has been\nremoved to avoid losing too much resolution at the early stage of the training process34. Depending on the size\nof the temporal domain T of the input spectrogram, defined by the chosen training sequence length and corresponding FFT-settings, a 512-large global-averaged pooled feature vector, derived from the 512 × F × T feature\nmaps of the last residual layer (see Fig. 2), is generated and mapped to a subsequent fully-connected layer34.

ANIMAL-SPOT is capable of\nhandling any number of output classes, and consequently dealing with multi-class classification scenarios as\nwell. Moreover, ANIMAL-SPOT integrates a refactored version of the entire data parsing and pre-processing\npipeline of ORCA-SPOT34, next to additional normalization techniques, in order to handle and fulfill all needed\nprerequisites required for dealing with various animal data sources (see Fig. 1 and Tables 1, 2, 3, 4), in combination with varying classification scenarios. Although advances in neural network structures have been made in\nrecent years, the focus of ANIMAL-SPOT is not a specific type of architecture (e.g., ResNet18, etc.). Instead, the\naim of ANIMAL-SPOT is to provide an open-source, animal-independent, and expandable machine learning\nframework, together with a robust and efficient data preprocessing pipeline. We add support by profound user\nguidelines to address the broadest possible audience. In addition, the capacity of the model used here is comparatively small, which facilitate researchers who may not have the opportunity to access powerful hardware,\nto train and evaluate their own animal- and task-specific models. Within the ANIMAL-SPOT framework it is\npossible to integrate any kind of architectural model designs, allowing the deployment of other novel and userpreferred deep neural network concepts.\nData preprocessing. Independent of the classification scenario all species and their corresponding data\nrepositories (see Tables 1, 2, and 3), followed the same generic data preprocessing pipeline. The core functions\nare applicable for all animals, however each species requires an animal-specific parameter set (see Supplementary Table S2) in order to guarantee valid data preparation and representation of the corresponding signal characteristics (e.g., typical vocalization duration, frequency range, sampling rate, Fast-Fourier-Transform (FFT)\nparameters, etc.). The entire preprocessing pipeline of ANIMAL-SPOT consists of the following steps: (1) conversion to mono and re-sampling, (2) Short-Time-Fourier-Transform (STFT) to convert the time signal into\na F  ×  T-large power-spectrogram using an animal-characteristic FFT window-length and step-size, where F\ncharacterizes the frequency domain and T describes the time domain, (3) integrated and concurrent signal augmentation with respect to the previous derived F × T-large power-spectrogram applying uniformly distributed\nrandom scalings including intensity, pitch, and time augmentation within given intervals (see Supplementary\nTable S2), where the default interval might slightly vary from species to species, (4) linear frequency compression (nearest neighbor, 256 frequency bins) representing a frequency range between fmin and fmax, while ignoring other frequency regions, chosen according to the typical spectral vocalization areas of the corresponding\nanimals, resulting in a 256 × T compressed power spectrogram, (5) noise augmentation by adding a pitch-/\ntime-augmented and frequency-compressed noise spectrogram utilizing a uniformly distributed randomly chosen signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), (6) power-spectrogram conversion to decibel (dB) scale, (7) 0/1-min/max- or\n0/1-dB-normalization, either using the spectral minimum and maximum, or applying a minimum and reference\ndecibel level, dependent on the respective target species, to normalize the spectral envelope, and (8) random\nsub-sampling or zero-padding of the spectrogram according to the chosen sequence length, leading to a final\n256 × T augmented and normalized spectral clip being used as network input. Figure 3 visualizes example network input spectrograms for each species, preprocessed according to the illustrated pipeline.\nNetwork training and evaluation. Due to ANIMAL-SPOT’s ResNet18-based feature extraction and\ncompression path (see Fig. 2), each input spectrogram is compressed by a factor of 16 during encoding, both\nin time T and in frequency F domain. The remaining F × T features for each of the 512 channels are mapped\nto the corresponding fully connected layer, conducting global average pooling, followed by a projection to the\nnumber of parametrizable output nodes/classes. During training, random data augmentation and sub-sampling/\npadding, can be enabled. However, to compare validation and test set results across various models, random\ndata augmentation and sub-sampling/padding was disabled. Validation and test samples were centered and\neither zero-padded or sub-sampled, in case the original length did not match the chosen sequence length34.\nANIMAL-SPOT was implemented in PyTorch17 using a cross entropy loss in combination with a batch-size of\n8 for all animals, together with an Adam optimizer applying an initial learning of 10−5, β1 = 0.5, and β2 = 0.999.\nAdditionally, ANIMAL-SPOT integrates a learning rate decay of 1/2 after 4 epochs without any improvement\non the validation set. The training was stopped after an animal-specific number of epochs (see Supplementary\nFigure 2.  ANIMAL-SPOT Network Architecture (created via Inkscape39, Version 0.92.3).\n7\nVol.:(0123456789)\nScientific Reports | (2022) 12:21966 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-26429-y\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\nTable S2) if no improvement was achieved on the validation set (early stopping). The accuracy was chosen as an\nappropriate network validation criterion. ANIMAL-SPOT integrates an intelligent data split mechanism, capable of automatically identifying all class labels, assuming that data preparation was performed in the prescribed\nformat33, and ensures that samples of a particular recording are only present in one of the splits. By default, the\ndata split is 70% for training, 15% validation, and 15% test. However, it may differ depending on the original data\ndistribution in combination with the above mentioned recording restriction (see Supplementary Tables S4–S6).\nRegarding the two challenge datasets—BirdVox-Full-Night36 and ComParE-PRS37,38—the original predefined\ndata splits have been applied for reasons of comparison. Network training and evaluation was computed utilizing mid-range graphics processing units (GPUs) (e.g., Nvidia GTX 1080), as well as standard central processing\nunits (CPUs), showing the broad applicability of the training setup. Supplementary Table S2 reports all animalspecific network-hyperparameters.\nANIMAL-SPOT’s network performance was evaluated via the following experimental constellations: (1)\nanimal- and scenario-specific model evaluation for target/noise detection (see Supplementary Table S3) and\nmulti-class classification (see Supplementary Tables S4, S5, S6), reporting various performance metrics regarding training, validation, and unseen test set, (2) evaluation of animal-specific target/noise detection networks\non three fully-annotated unseen test recordings, performing a sliding window approach in combination with\na given window-length ǫ and step-size κ to frame-wise segment between target and noise, and (3) inspection\nand verification of the multi-class classification models for warblers and monk parakeets based on the machinesegmented and extracted signal parts of step 2, generated by the corresponding segmentation models.\nThe first evaluation scenario visualizes the following training, validation, and test metrics: accuracy (ACC),\ntrue-positive-rate (TPR), false-positive-rate (FPR), precision (PREC), F1-score (F1), and area under the ROC\ncurve (AUC). In case of the ComParE-PRS37,38 primate species recognition challenge, only the unweighted average recall (UAR) was reported due to comparability reasons.\nThe second evaluation procedure classifies audio sections for each of the three unseen, animal-specific test\nrecordings, depending on the defined window-length ǫ and step-size κ, affecting the signal overlap, as a whole.\nMachine-predicted audio chunks are compared frame-by-frame with the ground truth34. Each predicted frame/\nsegment of the unseen recordings, together with the respective frame-wise network confidence (probability),\nallow to present the ROC-curve44 and its respective AUC34. In addition, frames showing a larger value than a\nmodel confidence δ, are transformed into an annotation with its corresponding start and end time. Therefore,\nsuccessive frames of the same label (noise = 0 or target = 1) are concatenated and extracted as one annotation\nexcerpt34. Frame-wise smoothing was used to mark classified noise segments as target frames if the neighboring\nsignal chunks are exclusively labeled as target signals34. Neighboring frames are frames which include preceding or subsequent signal content of the current sound segment because of the respective overlap34. ANIMALSPOT-S refers to the smoothed version, whereas ANIMAL-SPOT corresponds to the non-smoothed variant\n(see Supplementary Figs. S2–S12). Additionally, the predicted, smoothed, and extracted network detections\nwith an exemplary model confidence of δ ≥ 50% and δ ≥ 90%, were used to calculate and report time-wise\nprecision (PREC) versus corresponding recall (TPR), in order to show intersection accuracy between machineand human-annotated labels. To calculate time-based precision and recall all ground truth annotations, which\nare not further apart than a merging factor ξ = ǫ\n2 (half of the prediction window in seconds), were combined to\none annotation, since such cases lead to sliding windows ǫ, while at least half of the window contains animal\nvocalizations. In case of time-wise precision calculation an additional overlapping factor \u001f = ǫ\n2 was introduced,\nFigure 3.  ANIMAL-SPOT preprocessed 256 × 128-large network input spectrograms (256 frequency bins, 128\ntime frames) utilizing animal-specific network-hyperparameters listed in Supplementary Table S2 (created via\nInkscape39, Version 0.92.3).\n8\nVol:.(1234567890)\nScientific Reports | (2022) 12:21966 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-26429-y\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\nextending the ground truth annotation start and end accordingly (start − \u001f, end + \u001f), covering overlapping\npredictions at the annotation borders.\nThe third and last evaluation scenario reports results on multi-class classification by presenting the following\nevaluation criteria on training, validation, and test data: (1) accuracy, (2) confusion matrix, and (3) UAR (only for\nthe ComParE-PRS37,38 dataset). Additionally, the model was evaluated on the corresponding machine-annotated\nwarbler and monk parakeet results, utilizing the same sliding window approach. However, during prediction of\nthe multiple classes, a noise identification was only considered as correct if the network confidence was higher\nthan > 85%, due to the assumption that the previous detection process has a low false positive rate. If the network’s\nconfidence regarding noise was lower than this boundary, but still the highest probability, it was ignored and the\nsecond largest confidence value was chosen as correct prediction. The chosen window length, in combination\nwith the input file duration, ends up in two potential cases: (1) window length is larger than the input file duration, leading to an updated window equal to the pre-segmented audio clip, and (2) window size is shorter than\nthe input file size, leading to a sliding, frame-wise classification approach determined by window- and step-size,\nwhile only considering full windows in order to avoid potential misclassification. If multiple sequentially-ordered\nframe-wise classifications per pre-segmented file exist, probabilities of each frame and predicted class are summed\nup cumulatively. Finally, the class providing the largest probability mass was selected. All detection and multiclass species/call type classification metrics are visualized and illustrated in Figs. 4, 5, 6, as well as Supplementary\nTable S7 and Supplementary Figs. S2–S12.\nANIMAL‑SPOT guide. The ANIMAL-SPOT Guide33 is a step-by-step and detailed user guide, publicly\navailable together with the source code33, which enables researchers to train and evaluate animal-specific deep\nneural networks on their own bioacoustic data corpora (see Supplementary Fig. S1). The guidelines involve:\n(1) operating-system independent installation, data preparation, and detailed documentation of the ANIMALSPOT source code33, (2) instructions and guidance in order to set up, train, and evaluate animal- and scenariospecific architectures, as well as (3) use-case dependent prediction of unseen data material utilizing stand-alone\nnoise/target detection models, species/call type classification networks, or a combined version of detection and\nsubsequent classification (see Supplementary Fig. S1). The ANIMAL-SPOT guide provides a detailed description with respect to the following three scenarios: (1) single-stage detection between animal vocalizations of\ninterest and noise, based on unseen data, (2) single-stage classification of animal species and/or specific call\ntypes directly on unseen raw audio material, and (3) a combined version of step 1 and 2 by firstly pre-segmenting\nunseen audio recordings, followed by subsequent classification (animal species, call types, etc.), while taking\nonly the respective pre-segmented target vocalizations as input.\nExperiments\nAnimal‑species target/noise segmentation. In a first experiment animal-species segmentation was\nperformed for all animal-specific (see Fig. 1) data volumes listed in Table 1. Data partitioning was conducted\nfor each animal-specific data archive (see Supplementary Table S3), whereas the training set comprises ≈70%,\nvalidation and test set each ≈15% of the total labeled data corpora listed in Table 1. Using the respective data\ndistributions in combination with the animal-specific network-hyper-parameters presented in Supplementary Table S2, different ANIMAL-SPOT architectures were trained and evaluated according to the previously\ndescribed network training and evaluation procedure. An exception is the BirdVox-Full-Night36 challenge dataset (see Table 1, last row), which used the same data distribution, training, and evaluation procedure as described\nin Lostanlen et al.36, in order to allow a meaningful comparison with the original results. Consequently, a leaveone-out testing procedure whereby one unit of the given six was utilized for testing and the other five were used\nfor training and validation. This results in exactly the same data split as reported, but also means that there exist\nno additional and unseen data available for further evaluation, as it was the case for all other data corpora listed\nFigure 4.  Overall summary across all 11 animal-specific segmentation models (10 different species, 1\nadditional genus), visualizing performance metrics with respect to the animal-specific, unseen, human-labeled\ntest data (1.1), ROC-curves and AUC-Range (1.2), as well as threshold-dependent precision/recall values (1.3),\nboth based on the animal-related unseen recording tapes (see also species-specific results in Supplementary\nFigs.

To demonstrate, prove and verify performance of the proposed\nmulti-step classification procedure, three of the 12 animal species (see Fig.  1) were utilized—Golden-/Bluewinged warblers (genus) and monk parakeets.\nIn case of the warblers a subsequent multi-class classification model, trained on the data and distribution listed\nin Supplementary Table S4, was used to further separate the genus-specific and previously machine-segmented\ndata pool into Golden-winged, Blue-winged warblers, other birds, and noise. To counteract possible false alarms\nfrom the segmentation phase, two classes—other birds and noise—were introduced besides the corresponding\nsignals of interest.\nThe proposed multi-stage approach was further evaluated training a multi-class classification network to differentiate between various monk parakeet call types, using the data and distribution in Supplementary Table S5,\nincluding contact, alarm, and other calls, as well as noise, in order to handle previous segmentation errors.\nIn case of the golden- and blue-winged warblers, a total of 210 machine-annotated audio segments were\nextracted utilizing a network confidence of ≥ 90%. Under identical conditions 103 monk parakeet machine\nsegmentations were predicted and extracted. Example spectrograms for golden-/blue-winged warbler vocalizations, as well as for the various monk parakeet call types, are visualized in Figs. 5 and 6.\nIn order to assess the efficacy of the multi-stage approach, instead of a single-stage multi-class approach, a\nmulti-class model was exemplarily trained to perform detection and classification of Golden-winged warbler,\nBlue-winged warbler, and noise (pure background noise, other birds) in one step, using exactly the same three\nunseen, manually labeled recordings for evaluation as during the detection phase within the multi-stage procedure (see Table 1). The three audio files contain either: (1) only Golden-winged warblers, (2) only Blue-winged\nwarblers, (3) a combination of both warbler types. The model used the same data distribution for Golden-/\nBlue-winged warbler as stated in Supplementary Table S4, together with the warbler noise distribution listed in\nSupplementary Table S3.\nNevertheless, in order to also show and demonstrate the possibility of directly training a multi-species classification network without previous segmentation, the ComParE-PRS dataset (see Table 4) was used to distinguish\nbetween 4 different primate species as well as background noise, trained on the given data distribution listed in\nSupplementary Table S6.\nResults\nAnimal‑species target/noise segmentation. ANIMAL-SPOT successfully segmented all 10 target species, as well as the additional genus, leading to an overall mean test set accuracy of 97.9% (range: 94.5–99.8%).\nAdditionally, an average area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 95.9% (range: 91.7–99.1%) across all 33 unseen\nanimal-specific recordings (3 tapes per detection scenario) was achieved (see Supplementary Table S7. Besides\nnetwork generalization on the unseen tapes, a detailed performance overview with respect to model training,\nvalidation, and testing is reported and visualized in Supplementary Figs.  S2–S12. In addition, all detection\nresults are summarized and available in Supplementary Table S7. Moreover, Fig. 4 summarizes detection results\nin a compressed version, averaged across all 11 animal-specific segmentation models (10 different species, 1\nadditional genus), visualizing: (1) network performance metrics based on the animal-specific human-annotated\ntraining, validation, and testing repositories (see Supplementary Table S3, Fig. 4—1.1), (2) model results across\nall 11 averaged Receiver-Operating-Characteristics44 (ROC) curves by visualizing 2 out of 11 curves, indicating\nthe minimum and maximum AUC, spanning the average AUC-range where all other remaining ROC-curves\nare located (Fig. 4—1.2), and (3) network output across all 11 averaged and threshold-dependent precision/\nrecall scores (Fig. 4—1.3). Apart from the segmentation results of all 11 animal-specific segmentation models\n(10 different species, 1 additional genus), ANIMAL-SPOT also successfully processed the BirdVox-Full-Night36\ndataset. In comparison to the results given by Lostanlen et  al.36, with the best performance coming from a\nCNN with noise augmentation, which resulted in an average accuracy of 94.9% and an average F1-Score of\n62.7%, ANIMAL-SPOT achieved a slightly better average accuracy of 95.4% and a significantly better F1-Score\nof 95.4%. These results were achieved by training 10 models for each unit and taking the average of the results\nwhen removing the best and worst two performing models, resulting in an average over six models for each unit.\nMulti‑class species and call type classification. Multi-class species classification was applied to the\nprevious warbler target/noise detection results (see Supplementary Fig.  S6), in order to further separate the\nmachine-segmented warbler species vocalizations, exemplarily visualized in Fig. 5—1.1,1.2, into Blue-winged\nand Golden-winged warbler, resulting in a multi-class (4-classes) species identification scenario. Therefore,\nANIMAL-SPOT, trained in a multi-class species classification scenario using the data listed in Supplementary\nTable S4, achieved an overall accuracy of 96.6% for the human-labeled unseen test set, as well as 95.2% with\nrespect to the total number of 210 previously machine-detected audio segments (see Supplementary Fig. S6).\nMoreover, training and validation accuracy is shown besides two confusion matrices (4 classes), visualizing the\naforementioned results achieved on the respective unseen human-labeled and machine-segmented test corpora\n(see Fig. 5—1.3–1.5, Supplementary Fig. S6).\nCompared to the results of the proposed two-stage approach, which includes target/noise detection and downstream multi-class identification, the single-stage method, which performs both, detection and classification, in a\nmulti-class model at once, performed significantly worse. Across all three unseen warbler recordings the Golden-/\nBlue-winged warbler detection model (threshold δ≥ 0.9) identified a total of 210 potential vocalizations of interest, resulting in a time-based precision of 95.3% (see Supplementary Fig. S6). All 210 of the segmented samples\nwere then used for downstream multi-class classification. In comparison, the 3-class single-stage approach\ndetected 233 warbler events, with 200 true predictions resulting in a sample-based precision of 85.8%, whereas\njust 77.3% (180 out of 233 vocal events) were detected and classified as the correct warbler species. In the case \n11\nVol.:(0123456789)\nScientific Reports | (2022) 12:21966 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-26429-y\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\nof the two-stage approach multi-species classification achieved an accuracy of 95.2% (see Fig. 5). This indicates\nthat a two-step approach, where the network can focus more on the distinguishing features of the individual bird\nspecies without also having to filter out as much noise, is preferable to a single-step approach.\nBesides all the results regarding warbler-species classification, ANIMAL-SPOT was also successfully deployed\nto identify various primate species using the Computational Paralinguistics Challenge Primate (ComParEPRS)37,38 data archive. The initial challenge investigation utilizes five different approaches for feature extraction\nand classification of primate vocalizations, namely openSMILE45, openXBOW46, DeepSpectrum47, AuDeep48,\nand End2You49 in conjunction with either an SVM (openSMILE, openXBOW, DeepSpectrum, AuDeep) or a\nrecurrent neural network (RNN) (End2You) for the final classification. The initial baseline for the challenge,\ncalculated by majority voting using the best configuration for each approach, reported the best unweighted\naverage recall (UAR) of 87.5%37,38. In comparison, ANIMAL-SPOT outperformed the baseline achieving a UAR\nof 89.3%. Multi-class call type classification was applied to the previous monk parakeet target/noise detection\nresults (see Supplementary Fig. S5), similarly to the warblers, however, with the aim to classify between different\ncall types visualized in Fig. 6—1.1–1.3, leading to a multi-class (4 classes) monk parakeet call type classification\nscenario. For this purpose, ANIMAL-SPOT was trained on the data listed in Supplementary Table S5. The final\nmodel achieved an overall test set accuracy of 92.7%, compared to 88.4% on the previous machine-based detection results (see Fig. 6—1.4–1.6, Supplementary Fig. S5).\nDiscussion and future outlook\nIn total, 10 different species and 1 extra genus (see Figs. 1, 4, Supplementary Figs. S2–S12), as well as the publiclyavailable BirdVox-Full-Night36 dataset, were analyzed in a binary detection scenario in order to prove ANIMALSPOT’s ability to generalize across a wide variety of sound-types and to assess the feasibility of the proposed\nmulti-stage detection/classification pipeline (see Figs. 5 and 6). As the results on the unseen recordings prove,\npromising time-wise and threshold-dependent recall/precision values were achieved, indicating an accurate\nintersection between ANIMAL-SPOT’s predictions and the actual ground truth (see Fig. 4—1.3, Supplementary\nTable S7 and Supplementary Figs. S2–S12). In addition, ROC-curves and corresponding AUC values show a\nsignificant reduction of the species-dependent and original noise-heavy data material (see Fig. 4—1.2). Thus,\nthreshold-dependent recall and false-positive-rate combinations can be derived according to the respective usecase, which in turn considerably speeds up and improves downstream data analysis. Furthermore, the combined\nstrong results seen in both unseen test set as well as unseen real-world recordings, suggest no indication of model\noverfitting and prove network generalization across all different animal species.\nThe improvements with respect to the publicly available BirdVox-Full-Night36 dataset are also very promising, as the detection accuracy was improved by 0.6%, which indicates an error reduction of about 12%, besides\na significant improvement of 32.7% regarding the F1-Score.\nANIMAL-SPOT integrates a large repertoire of distinct parameterization options for setting up data preprocessing and network training (see Supplementary Table S2). Thus, ANIMAL-SPOT performs equally across\nwide ranges of temporal contexts (e.g average vocalization duration of Pygmy pipistrelles compared to killer\nwhales), frequency ranges (e.g low-range Atlantic cod and Harbour seal vocalizations, mid-range bird sounds,\nand ultrasound bat signals), as well as spectral patterns (e.g., pulse-like structure of the Harbour seal or warbler\nsignals and harmonic properties of the killer whale, Atlantic cod, and chimpanzee vocalizations). It is even possible to learn and distinguish between spectral call structures which are very similar to noise, seen in ANIMALSPOT’s exemplary ability to distinguish Sulphur-crested cockatoo, Harbour seal, monk parakeet, and chimpanzee\nvocalizations from very similar background noise. In case of binary target/noise detection, ANIMAL-SPOT is\nespecially useful in recording situations where the noise characteristics are an order of magnitude larger than\nthe amount of valuable animal vocalizations.\nANIMAL-SPOT’s parameterization capacity also enables flexible adaptations regarding model architecture,\ndata preprocessing, and network training/evaluation, allowing researchers to address and answer various specific\nbioacoustic research questions. Furthermore, the binary-class target/noise detection process enables researchers\nto separate target species that show poor results in the single-stage binary target/noise detection scenario. This\ncan occur especially when the target species spectrally resemble other vocalizing species that are also found in\nthe unseen recordings. In such situations the primary focus is on a generic distinction between target vocalizations and superfluous noise, making subtle spectral differences of other species difficult to model, because of\ngeneralization properties across both classes leading to increasing mis-classifications. This phenomenon was\nobserved in case of Blue-winged and Golden-winged warblers, after both were individually trained and analyzed\non species level, which demonstrated significant performance variations. However, using a two-step identification scenario consisting of target/noise detection at genus level (see Supplementary Fig. S6), and subsequent\nmulti-class species classification, ANIMAL-SPOT achieved an overall test set accuracy of 96.6% on unseen test\ndata, which had been labeled by a human expert, and an accuracy of 95.2% on the target detections identified\nby ANIMAL-SPOT in the target/noise detection scenario (see Fig. 5).\nIn addition, the same two-step approach was successfully applied to distinguish and classify between different\nmonk parakeet call types, resulting in 92.7% test set accuracy for human-annotated samples, and 88.4% with\nrespect to the machine-performed detection results (see Supplementary Fig. S5, see Fig. 6). These combined\nresults demonstrate the wide range of biological scenarios which can be covered by ANIMAL-SPOT in combination with user- and animal-specific data material. In both multi-class classification scenarios—warbler species\nand monk parakeet call types—ANIMAL-SPOT extracts and classifies centered signal sections of the unseen\nnetwork test set samples according to the training sequence length (see Supplementary Table S2, see Figs. 5—1.4\nand 6—1.5). However, the pre-segmented audio chunks, different in length, were classified by utilizing a sliding\nwindow approach, together with the corresponding settings (see Figs. 5—1.5 and 6—1.6). At each frame the \n12\nVol:.(1234567890)\nScientific Reports | (2022) 12:21966 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-26429-y\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\nmaximum probability of all classes was chosen. The class showing the highest probability mass across the entire\nsignal was selected as the final network hypothesis. In both experiments, each of the confusion matrices show\ncomprehensible and similar results, being an auspicious indicator for model generalization across various data\n(see Figs. 5—1.4,1.5 and 6—1.5,1.6). Furthermore, sequence length and step-size are very important parameters\nto guarantee robust predictions. In terms of species and/or call type classification the step-size should be an\norder of magnitude smaller than the sequence length, in order to guarantee sufficient overlap and not to miss\nimportant spectral features during the prediction phase.\nANIMAL-SPOT demonstrated also great results in terms of single-stage multi-species primate classification, by outperforming the ComParE baseline system. The final result of 89.3% also exceeds the UAR of 88.3%\npresented by challenge competitor Illium et al.50, who applied a vision transformer to the classification problem.\nMüller et al.51 report the same UAR of 89.3% while applying a Deep Recurrent Neural Network. The remaining\ncompetitors who performed better than ANIMAL-SPOT utilized either ensembling of multiple classifiers, as in\nthe case of Egas-López et al.52, who achieved a UAR of 89.8%, or data augmentation techniques such as SpecAugment or MixUp and training tricks such as exponential moving average of the model weights, as presented by\nThomas Pellegrini53, who achieved a UAR of 92.5% on the test set. ANIMAL-SPOT is therefore placed squarely\nin the middle of the top challenge performers despite using only a single, relatively simple classifier and basic\naugmentation techniques.\nIn order to robustly train and report promising results, data volume, distribution, and variation is crucial.\nMoreover, the data corpus must be representative with respect to unseen real-world data. If these criteria are not\nfulfilled, models often lead to significantly worse results, despite promising training, validation, and test metrics.\nIn order to enlarge data variation, especially for small animal corpora, various embedded spectral augmentations\nwere computed (see Supplementary Table S2). However, such augmentation variants and corresponding values\nmust be determined independently for each animal species and can therefore not be generalized. In particular,\nnoise augmentation must be applied carefully, because of differing Signal-to-Noise-Ratio (SNR) between the\noriginal sounds and utilized noise data, particularly in case of animal vocalizations being very similar to noise\ndata (e.g., Sulphur-crested cockatoo, distant chimpanzee pant-hoot versus bird vocalizations in the same frequency range). Therefore, it is essential to ensure that noise samples, chosen for augmentation, are representative\nand independent from training, validation, and test noise excerpts. Despite promising scenario- and animalspecific results on the unseen test data, audio recordings, machine-driven pre-detections, and challenge datasets\n(see Figs. 4, 5, 6, Supplementary Figs. S2–S12, and Supplementary Table S7), the performance may still vary to\na certain extent, due to the following reasons: (1) non-representative data and/or insufficient training data, (2)\nrecording artifacts introducing spectral outliers which are difficult to interpret by the network, (3) other animal\nvocalizations or noise characteristics showing a similar spectral envelope as the target sounds, (4) strong deviation\nof the signal intensities compared to the chosen reference and minimum dB-values of the 0/1-dB-normalization\nduring training (see Supplementary Table S2), (5) overlapping animal signals and human narrations, (6) vocalization types of a given species which have significant spectral and temporal differences between each other, and\n(7) window-length ǫ and step-size κ used during prediction phase. Figure 7 visualizes different examples of such\nanimal- and task-specific misclassifications, caused by the previously illustrated error sources, which significantly\ninfluence network prediction results.\nFigure 7.  Spectrogram examples visualizing potential error sources leading to performance drops of ANIMALSPOT (created via Inkscape39, Version 0.92.3).\n13\nVol.:(0123456789)\nScientific Reports | (2022) 12:21966 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-26429-y\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\nFurthermore, during multi-class classification, special attention needs to be paid towards correct machinebased detection outputs indicating one of the following scenarios: (1) multiple vocalizations of the same and/\nor different species/call types within a single segment, (2) truncated signals, either at the beginning or end of\na segment, and (3) overlapping vocalizations. Examples of the above mentioned and remaining challenges are\nvisualized in Fig. 8.\nIn addition, data collection should be conducted via a consistent recording setup. Including data material\noriginating from varying recording environments and/or setups will result in spurious outputs unless sufficient\nexamples of this variation is represented in the training and validation datasets.\nANIMAL-SPOT’s performance and network training stabilization strongly correlates with the chosen hyperparameter setup, respective data structure and distribution, as well as model initialization. In order to identify\nthe best fitting training setup for a certain species and classification procedure, a parametric search within the\ntarget-specific value range (with regards to e.g., signal frequency range, average sound duration, type of vocalization) should be performed. Additionally suitable prediction settings—window length ǫ and step-size κ—as well as\nnetwork parameters (see Supplementary Table S2) are very important. Window length ǫ has to be approximately\nin the same dimension as the network training length. To ensure adequate prediction settings, ANIMAL-SPOT\nshould be evaluated on a small portion of unseen manually labeled recordings, before processing large unseen\ndata archives. Moreover, network initialization, as well as random augmentations during training, may impact\nnetwork performance, especially in case of small training corpora, affecting final model performance despite\nsimilar training, validation, and test set metrics.\nResearchers face various acoustic detection scenarios, namely simple target/noise segmentation, identification\nof target signals among other distinct animal-specific vocalizations, and the recognition of target vocalizations\namong other similar animal-related vocalizations. All these scenarios can be addressed by the ANIMAL-SPOT\nframework and its underlying methods. For the simple case of identifying a target signal among nondescript\nbackground noise a simple one-step procedure can be applied as well as utilization of the framework-supplied\nnoise augmentation to account for differences in signal-to-noise ratios in varying real-world conditions. Similarly,\nin the case where the target signal is dissimilar to the to other known vocalizations, a one-step model application\nprocedure can be applied, and the classification is altered from a binary target-noise scenario to a multi-class\nproblem which includes vocalizations from other known species present in the recordings. Finally, when dealing\nwith the scenario in which the target vocalization exhibits similar characteristics such as to make them difficult\nto discern from each other, a multi-step approach can be taken, as was shown when attempting to accurately\ndistinguish between Blue and Golden-winged warblers (see Fig. 5) or different monk parakeet call types (see\nFig. 6). The same applies to the recognition of species-specific dialects and single individuals. The first task is\nto eliminate to the fullest extent the background noise (pure noise, other dissimilar animal vocalizations) from\nthe classification problem. After background noise is removed from the data, it appears that the model is more\ncapable of distinguishing between similar acoustic features through the focus on other spectral characteristics\nand features. Note that, due to the relatively small model sizes used here, a two-step approach could also be\napplied to the case where vocalizations are dissimilar without incurring a significant penalty with respect to\ncomputation time.\nBesides the animal-independent target/noise and multi-step/class identification results (see Figs. 4, 5, and 6),\nthis study also puts special emphasis on the proposed ANIMAL-SPOT guide33 (see Supplementary Fig. S1), which\nenables researchers to setup their own user-specific deep learning framework, without the need of prior machinelearning knowledge. The ANIMAL-SPOT guide33 describes the entire software framework from beginning to\nend, including OS-specific installation manuals regarding all necessary software components, data preparation\nand processing guidelines, as well as detailed descriptions on how to setup, train, and run the final network\nprediction/evaluation on unseen data (see Supplementary Fig. S1).\nThe entire deep learning framework, as well as user- and animal-specific setup, can be verified and evaluated\nthrough the additionally provided example data archive on monk parakeets54 , which is publicly available33, next\nto all the source code and user-friendly instruction manual. This guide enables the bioacoustic community to\nindependently train/evaluate task- and animal-specific deep models in order to gain deeper insights into animal\ncommunication and understanding.\nFigure 8.  Machine-segmented spectrograms for Blue-/Golden-winged warblers and monk parakeets,\nvisualizing various challenging scenarios for a potential subsequent multi-class classification (created via\nInkscape39, Version 0.92.3).\n14\nVol:.(1234567890)\nScientific Reports | (2022) 12:21966 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-26429-y\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\nMany different fields of potential future follow-up work arise, such as (1) animal-specific representation55\nand/or transfer learning, utilizing larger labeled/unlabeled bioacoustic data corpora and/or other data archives\n(e.g., ImageNet56), (2) investigation regarding various deep network architectures (e.g., CNN-LSTM25, ResNeXt57,\nInception/Inception-ResNet58, or Transformer-based approaches59), and (3) animal-independent signal enhancement/denoising60, acting as additional data preprocessing option. To the best of the authors knowledge, ANIMAL-SPOT is the first open-source33 machine learning approach, capable of handling various bioacoustic signal\nidentification scenarios (binary target/noise detection, multi-class species/call type classification), verified on a\nwide portfolio of animal vocalizations from different animal taxa and challenge datasets.

Assymetrical production and perception of situationally specific vocalizations. Ethology 101, 25—32.\n\nAbstract\n\nMany species produce alarm calls that vary according to situation. An implicit assumption for these species is that production and perception of situationally specific alarm calls is symmetrical: perceivers respond to variation produced by signalers. The companion paper to this one (BLUMSTEIN 1995) showed that golden marmots (Marmota caudata aurea) produce variable alarm calls that vary in proportion to the degree of risk the caller perceives. Calls produced in higher-risk situations have fewer notes than calls produced in lower-risk situations. In this study, to determine the salience of the number of notes per call in eliciting different responses in conspecific perceivers, I played back three-note alarm calls, eight-note alarm calls, and the non-alarm vocalization of a local bird to adult golden marmots. Although marmots responded differently to bird calls and alarm calls, vigilance responses to the different alarm calls were similar. Several explanations may account for the apparent insensitivity to alarm-call variation: golden marmots may require additional contextual cues to properly interpret alarm calls, perceptual abilities do not parallel production abilities, or calls may serve a generalized alerting function.\n\nD.

Golden marmots (Marmota caudata aurea) produce situationally specific alarm calls. The results of my companion study (BLUMSTEIN 1995) suggest that the number of notes per call is inversely related to the degree of risk a calling marmot experiences when it calls. If call variation communicates the degree of risk or type of predator, then marmots who hear alarm calls should, in some way, respond differently to\n\nU.S. Copyright Clearance Center Code Statement: 0179-1613/95/1011-0025$11.00/0\n\n26 DANIEL T.

I conducted playback experiments to determine whether marmots had overtly different responses to higher risk (three-note) and lower risk (eight-note) alarm calls.\n\nMethods\n\nHigh-quality human-elicited marmot calls recorded from different individuals were used for this experiment (recording details in BLUMSTEIN (1995)). Calls were sampled at 44 kHz using an AudioMedia AD-DA board then filtered (1000—5000 kHz three-pole Butterworth bandpass filter) using Signalyze software (KELLER 1992) to remove environmental noise. Longer calls were shortened to three or eight notes using AudioMedia, and playback tapes were made using AudioMedia software (DIGIDESIGN 1990).\n\nA total of 10 three-note and 11 8-note examples (Fig. 1), exhibiting 'natural' variation in other acoustic parameters (bandwidth, minimum and maximum frequencies, duration, inter-note intervals), were used for the experiments. By using multiple examples of alarm calls, I was able to test the hypothesis that marmots respond to different types of alarm calls and not to different examples of alarm calls (MCGREGOR et al. 1992).\n\nMarmots did not produce other loud vocalizations (e.g. food or territorial calls) that could be used as a suitable control sound. Instead, I used a single 1.21-s song of a common alpine bird (black redstart: Phoenicurus ochruros) as a control stimulus (Fig. 1). A redstart song was selected because, while it is not an alarm call, it is pulsed like marmot alarm calls. The control sound was used to test the hypothesis that marmots respond to alarm calls and not just to the experimental setup, and/or to a sudden pulsed sound.\n\nMarmot Alarm Calls. II 27\n\nEach experimental marmot heard all three stimuli: a three-note call, an eight-note call, and the redstart song. Between marmots, playback order was systematically varied. To avoid possible habituation to played-back alarm calls, I attempted to limit playbacks in a given day to the number that a marmot might normally hear (X̄ = 2.67 playbacks per playback day, range 1—8 c.f.; marmots naturally hear 6—22 natural 'bouts' of alarm calls per day; BLUMSTEIN 1995).\n\nBefore marmots emerged from their burrows in the morning, the speakers and cables were set up and left in place throughout the morning (and occasionally afternoon) experimental period. Stone boxes to camouflage the speaker (between one and several per marmot group) were constructed at least 1 wk prior to experiments and were left throughout the season. I sat with the video camera (with an attached telephoto lens) and tape deck in one of four hides between 180 and 460 m from the speaker. Different stone boxes were used in playbacks conducted on subsequent days.\n\nSeveral additional criteria, to ensure maximal responsiveness, had to be met prior to a playback. Firstly, no natural alarm calls could have occurred in the past 30 min. Secondly, if a previous playback had been conducted, I waited at least 7 min before playing back another sound. Thirdly, since behavior, and potentially location, can influence responsiveness to a played-back alarm call (BLUMSTEIN 1994), I attempted to control for behavior by conducting playbacks only to marmots that were sitting and looking or standing and looking from their main burrows (X̄ distance to main burrow = 0.36 m, range 0—4 m).\n\nExamples of calls were played back on a Sony WM-D6C tape deck. The audio signal was split leaving the Sony headphone jack, sending the exemplar directly to a video camera (Sony SP-7, video 8) and also through an unbalanced-to-balanced line-conversion box (Countryman Type-85 Direct Box), across 365—455 m of balanced microphone cable, into a line amplifier (Sure FP11) that also converted the signal back to an unbalanced one, and finally to a Sony SRS-77G powered speaker with a relatively flat frequency response.\n\nSince playback volume may influence responsiveness (BLUMSTEIN 1994), line levels on the tape deck, line amplifier, and powered speaker were adjusted until the sound-pressure level, 0.1 m in front of the speaker, was about 100—104 dB (measured using a Realistic model 33—2050 sound-level meter). In fact, the average playback volume was 104.8 dB (range: 97—112 dB), and the speakers were 13.4 m from the marmots (range: 5.4—25.5 m).\n\nThe playback situation mimicked the situation of a distant marmot calling. Depending on the exact location of the speaker, the hypothetical 'caller' could have been from the same or an adjacent social group. Marmots routinely responded to alarm calls produced throughout the meadow.\n\nSingle-frame analysis of the video (temporal resolution = 0.033 s) permitted marmots' responses to playbacks to be measured. From the videotape, variables hypothesized to reflect responsiveness on different temporal scales were measured to search for differential responsiveness. Immediate responses were quantified by measuring: 1. The delay in responding to the played-back stimulus, defined as the time between the beginning of the playback and the beginning of the first look; and 2. The duration of the first look following the playback. Short-term responses were quantified by recording the number and duration of each bout of looking in the first 17 s. This time was chosen because the average time between alarm calls was 17 s (BLUMSTEIN 1995). Longer-term responses were quantified by recording the number and duration of each bout of looking in the first 59 s following the playback. While any differential responsiveness to alarm-call variants would have been telling, I anticipated the number of looks and the time spent looking to be positively associated with the degree of risk 'encoded' in the call. Moreover, I anticipated shorter response times to alarm calls than to bird song.\n\nFriedman non-parametric ANOVAs (with no interaction effects) were used to test for differences in the responsiveness to these acoustic stimuli while controlling for individual variation. Pairwise post-hoc multiple comparisons were calculated using equation 7.5a from SIEGEL & CASTELLAN (1988).\n\nResults\n\nMarmots responded differently to alarm calls than to the bird song, but did not respond differently to three-note and eight-note alarm calls (Fig. 2). Between 24 May and 16 Aug. 1993, I played back the three different acoustic stimuli to 15 adult marmots (nine males/six females) in six different social groups. Overall, the\n\n28 DANIEL T.

Multiple pairwise comparisons revealed that marmots had indistinguishable response delays to alarm calls but took longer to respond to bird song than to eight-note alarm calls.\n\nThe duration of the first look following playbacks also differed among treatments (p = 0.017). Multiple comparisons suggested that marmots only differentiated three-note alarm calls from bird song. However, the comparison of eight-note alarm calls to bird song was close to the significantly different multiple-comparison criteria. The duration of the first look was indistinguishable between three-note and eight-note alarm calls. A longer first look in response to bird song than to alarm calls was expected since bird song was not supposed to be alarming: alarmed marmots appeared 'agitated' and looked around frequently. Marmots 'responding' to bird song tended to 'casually' look around and did not appear agitated.\n\nMarmot Alarm Calls. II 29\n\nNone of the short-term or long-term measurements of responsiveness differed significantly between treatments.\n\nDiscussion\nWhy Perceivers May Not Respond to Call Variation\n\nGiven the apparently robust relationship between the number of notes per call and the degree of risk the caller experiences when calling (BLUMSTEIN 1995), it is somewhat surprising that marmots did not respond differently to the played-back three-note and eight-note alarm calls. That marmots responded differently to alarm calls and the bird song suggests that marmots were not simply responding to sound coming from the speaker, nor to the pulsed playback. There are several non-mutually exclusive explanations of why marmots appeared not to differentiate alarm-call types.\n\nFirstly, measurements of vigilance may not be sensitive enough to detect slight, but perceptually meaningful, evidence of stimulus discrimination (HAUSER 1994). Yet, other investigators have found vigilance patterns to be sensitive measurements of response differences to acoustic stimuli (LEGER & OWINGS 1978; OWINGS & LEGER 1980; HARRIS et al. 1983; HAUSER 1986; CHENEY & SEYFARTH 1990; EVANS et al. 1993). Different measurements of responsiveness such as tail-pilo-erection onset time (COSS 1995), specific cardiac responses (EVANS & GAIONI 1990), or other autonomic nervous-system responses (BROOKS 1983), might have revealed significantly different responses to variants.\n\nSecondly, alarm calls alone may not have provided sufficient context for perceivers to properly interpret the meaning of the calls (SMITH 1977; LEGER 1993). Some species are able to recognize individuals by their vocalizations (GREEN & MARLER 1979; CONNER 1985; CHENEY & SEYFARTH 1990). Golden marmots live in sufficiently stable social groups for perceivers to have the opportunity to learn the special characteristics of their neighbors' calls and to include that knowledge in their assessment of a call's meaning: adding marmot identity increased the total explained variation in the number of notes per call; BLUMSTEIN (1995). Additionally, volume-related potential cues may have aided marmots' interpretation of an alarm call. Since these contextual cues were, by design, absent in this experiment, marmots might normally—with appropriate contextual cues—be able to differentiate alarm-call variants. Nevertheless, if these cues are required to respond differently, then the number of notes per call alone cannot communicate variation in predation risk. If so, the opportunity for asymmetrical production and perception seems plausible.\n\nThirdly, previous studies that found an ability for species to perceive temporal differences in calls have been conducted on species that have the ability to produce structurally different calls (LEGER & OWINGS 1978; HARRIS et al. 1983; STONE & TROST 1991; studies of Eurasian marmots by NIKOL'SKII & NESTEROVA 1988, 1989, 1990 (loc. cit. NIKOL'SKII et al. 1994) are apparent exceptions). However, some species, such as golden marmots, produce only temporally different calls. If the ability to produce structurally distinct call types was correlated with the\n\n30 DANIEL T. BLUMSTEIN\n\nability to differentiate call types, then species producing only temporally variable calls would be less able to differentiate alarm-call variants. This potential evolutionary constraint must be studied by investigating production and perception in the entire genus. Specifically, to determine whether perceptual abilities are correlated with production abilities, the order of trait evolution must be studied (BROOKS & MCLENNAN 1991).\n\nFourthly, it is probable that marmots use simple rules-of-thumb to assess predation risk (BOUSKILA & BLUMSTEIN 1992). An example of an assessment rule might be where perceivers treat any alarm call as representing an equivalent threat. If so, different calls would elicit identical responses. Assessing calls similarly might be a reasonably inexpensive strategy because: 1. The immediate response to an alarm call is looking and presumably assessing the situation; and 2. Alarm calls are not common. It is worth noting that calls may have been perceived differently but have had equivalent meanings to the marmots (see discussion of 'just meaningful difference' in NELSON & MARLER (1990)).\n\nFinally, the first alarm call might serve a generalized alerting function (BALPH & BALPH 1966). Perceivers might use changes in the number of notes in subsequent calls to assess the relative risk of predation (sensu BELETSKY et al. 1986). Given that a substantial amount of variation in the number of notes per call may be explained by knowing the caller's identity, a perceiver might pay less attention to the absolute number of notes per call in the first call than to how the number of notes from the same caller changes over time. If the change in the number of notes in subsequent calls is used to assess predation risk, degree of risk is not communicated immediately. While calls may be repeated to track risk, an alternative explanation of repeated calls is that they are used to maintain vigilance (SCHLEIDT 1973; OWINGS & VIRGINIA 1978; HARRIS et al. 1983; OWINGS & HENNESSY 1984; LOUGHRY & MCDONOUGH 1988). Yet, if risk is communicated over a larger time scale, then the inter-call interval would be a variable requiring additional study (see NIKOL'SKII et al. 1994).\n\nConclusions\n\nThis study underscores the importance of conducting playback experiments to study the meaning of alarm calls (GREEN & MARLER 1979). Many studies have looked for correlations between alarm call variation and stimulus variation. Such studies can be used to define what potential information is made available to perceivers. Relatively few investigators have played back alarm call variants to a species to determine whether variants are able to elicit different responses (but see: LEGER & OWINGS 1978; LEGER et al. 1979; SCHWAGMEYER & BROWN 1981; HARRIS et al. 1983; BROWN 1985; CHENEY & SEYFARTH 1990; MACEDONIA 1990; STONE & TROST 1991; NIKOL'SKII & NESTEROVA 1988, 1989, 1990 cited in NIKOL'SKII et al. 1994; BLUMSTEIN & ARNOLD 1995). Studies that only correlate call types with situation may erroneously assume that perceivers respond to call variation. Playback experiments must be conducted to determine whether subjects respond to different call types (MACEDONIA & EVANS 1993). It is theoretically possible that subjects do not respond differently to call variants. Com-\n\nMarmot Alarm Calls.

To study this recognition process, we played back to the\nchicks parental calls with acoustic parameters modified in the temporal and frequency domains. The\nparental call is composed of syllables (complex sounds with harmonic series) separated by pronounced\namplitude declines. Our experiments with modified signals indicate that the chick’s frequency analysis of\nthe call is not tuned towards precise peak energy values, the signal being recognized even when the carrier\nfrequency was shifted 100 Hz down or 75 Hz up. To recognize the adult, chicks used frequency rather\nthan amplitude modulation, in particular the frequency modulation shape of the syllable. This structure\nis repeated through the different syllables of the call giving a distinct vocal signature. Our experiments\nalso show that the receiver needs to perceive only a small part of the signal: the first half of the syllable\n(0.23 s) and the first three harmonics were sufficient to elicit recognition. The small amount of\ninformation necessary to understand the message, the high redundancy in the time and frequency\ndomains and the almost infinite possibilities of coding provided by the frequency modulation signature\npermit the chick to recognize the adult, without the help of a nest site. For these reasons, the code used\nin the call of the king penguin can be regarded as a functional code, increasing the possibility of\nindividual recognition in an acoustically constraining environment.\n 1999 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour\nIn birds, many vocal exchanges, particularly between\nmates and between parents and young, occur at short\nrange, over distances of a few metres at most (Falls 1982).\nAt these short distances, the signal is only weakly modified during propagation, by, for example, the ground\neffect, atmospheric absorption or geometric attenuation\n(Wiley & Richards 1978; Dabelsteen 1984; Dabelsteen\net al. 1993). Nevertheless, even at short range, communication between individuals may sometimes be difficult,\nfor example in noisy environments, such as dense\ncolonies of birds. In these colonies, a continuous background noise is generated by sounds used for communication and by other sounds such as wind, waves, beak\nclapping and wing flapping. The level of ambient noise is\nhigh (more than 70 dB: Robisson 1991; Mathevon 1996)\nand consequently the value of the signal-to-noise ratio is\nlow. In addition, the numerous vocalizations generate\njamming in both frequency and temporal domains. Thus,\nit is difficult for individuals in the colony to extract\ninformation from the background noise.\nSeabird colonies are particularly crowded and noisy.\nBreeding on land and feeding at sea, mates are separated\nfor days or weeks during the breeding season, but are\nfaithful to each other and to their offspring (see Jouventin\n1982 for penguins). The ability to recognize mates,\nparents or chicks is particularly important in seabird\ncolonies, where nest sites are densely packed, increasing\nthe possibility of confusion (Hutchison et al. 1968). To\nfind the egg(s) or chick(s), nesting birds also use landmarks, so to isolate vocal recognition in this study, we\nused a non-nesting species, the king penguin, Aptenodytes\npatagonicus.\nKing penguins breed on flat areas in homogeneous and\ndense monospecific colonies numbering thousands of\nbirds (1.6 breeders/m2 ; Guinet et al. 1995). There are no\nnest sites: each bird carries its egg and then its small chick\non its feet. At the end of the breeding cycle, as in our\nstudy, each individual is identified by its chick only by\nvocal cues (the ‘long call’ in the behavioural repertoire\ndescribed by Stonehouse 1960) and a few landmarks\n(Derenne et al. 1979 for the king penguin; Jouventin\nCorrespondence and present address: P. Jouventin, CEFE–CNRS UPR\n9056, 1919 Route de Mende, F-34213 Montpellier Cedex 5, France\n(email: jouventin@cefe.cnrs-mop.fr). T. Aubin is at NAM–CNRS URA\n1491, Universite ́ Paris-Sud, F-91400 Orsay, France.\n0003–3472/99/061175+09 $30.00/0  1999 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour11751982 for the penguin family). Observations of banded\nbirds and playback experiments show that only the mate\nresponds to its partner coming back. Similarly, chicks\nrespond only to their parents (or their calls played back).\nFor the chick, recognition of the parental call is important\nfor survival as parents usually only feed a chick they have\nidentified by its call (Jouventin 1982). Nevertheless, some\nadoptions do occur (Stonehouse 1960) by failed breeders\n(Jouventin & Mauget 1996).\nThat birds can recognize one another by voice alone\nhas been demonstrated repeatedly. In numerous studies\n(for reviews see Falls 1982; Dhondt & Lambrechts 1992),\nthe structure of the signal has been analysed, to\ndetermine which parameters encode acoustic identity\nand allow recognition between individuals. An ideal\nsignal for individual recognition would be highly\nstereotyped within each individual but would differ\nnoticeably between individuals. A method of quantifying\nthis is to define a ratio of acoustic parameters such\nas Cvb/Cvi, where Cvb is the coefficient of variation between individuals and Cvi the coefficient of\nvariation within individuals (Hutchison et al. 1968; for\na review see Scherrer 1984). The Cvb/Cvi ratio and\ncoefficients of correlation have been calculated for the\nking penguin call (Jouventin 1982; Robisson 1992;\nLengagne et al. 1997): the between-individual variation\nwas less stereotyped and on average three times greater\nthan the within-individual variation for time parameters\nand four times greater for frequency parameters. Thus,\nindividuals encode their call by making it highly\nstereotyped.\nKnowing that it is possible to distinguish the signals of\nindividuals statistically does not, however, tell us how\nbirds manage do it. Playback experiments are needed to\ninvestigate this. Our previous observations (Jouventin\n1982) and experiments (Aubin & Jouventin 1998) show\nthat king penguin chicks are able to decode a precise\nacoustic signal despite extreme jamming and high-level\nbackground noise generated by the colony (called the\n‘cocktail-party effect’ in humans by Cherry 1966), suggesting that a variety of fine details are fitted into the\ncode. How can penguins appreciate subtle qualities of\nsounds in such a noisy and jamming environment? How\ncan acoustic individuality be encoded when faced by such\nstrong acoustical constraints?\nDetection of signals in noise is a complex issue.\nThe most detailed knowledge of the mechanisms\ninvolved comes from psychoacoustic experiments\nperformed in controlled laboratory environments (Klump\n1996). Few field studies have studied experimentally\nhow signals of animals are detected amidst background\nnoise in the natural environment. The capacity of\nthe king penguin chick to recognize the parental\ncall requires peculiar strategies of coding/decoding.\nOur aim in this study was to determine to which\nacoustic parameters the chick is tuned in order to\nextract the information from the background noise. For\nthis purpose, we broadcast different parental calls modified in the frequency and temporal domains, to\nchicks waiting in the colony for their parents to return\nfrom the sea.\nMETHODS\nSubjects and Location\nWe studied king penguins at Ile Possession, Crozet\narchipelago (46)25*S, 51)45*E) from early December 1995\nto mid-January 1996. The study was conducted at Baie du\nMarin, in a large colony containing about 40 000 pairs\nof adults and 1500 chicks. The chicks we tested were\nbetween 10 and 12 months old. At this stage of its life, the\nchick is pushed away by new breeders from where the egg\nwas laid but is entirely dependent on its parents for food.\nTo identify them, we banded tested chicks on a flipper\nwith a temporary plastic band.\nRecording Procedure\nTo record parental calls of king penguins (the ‘long\ncall’ of Stonehouse 1960) we used an omnidirectional\nSennheiser MD211 microphone (frequency response\n150–18 000 Hz&1 dB) mounted on a 2.5-m perch and\nconnected to a Sony TCD10 Pro II digital audiotape\nrecorder (sampling frequency: 44.6 kHz, frequency\nresponse flat within the range 20–20 000 Hz&1 dB). The\ndistance between the beak of the recorded bird and the\nmicrophone was approximately 1 m.\nSound Synthesis and Analysis\nSignals were digitized with a 16-bit Oros Au21 acquisition card (with a 120-dB/octave antialiasing filter) at a\nsampling frequency of 16 kHz and stored on the hard disk\nof a PC computer. They were then examined and modified with the Syntana analytical package (Aubin 1994).\nSound pressure level measurements (SPL in dB) were\nmeasured with a Brue ̈l & Kjaer Sound Level Meter type\n2235 (linear scale, slow setting) equipped with a 1-inch\ncondenser microphone type 4176.\nPlayback Procedure\nFor playback experiments we used a 4200 Uher taperecorder (tape speed 19 cm/s) connected to a 50-W Audix\nPH3 self-powered loudspeaker (frequency response 100–\n5600 Hz&2 dB). Signals were played at a natural sound\npressure level (Robisson 1993a), of approximately 95 dB,\nmeasured 1 m from the loudspeaker.\nWe conducted tests between 1000 and 1700 hours,\nduring clear and dry weather, with a wind speed of less\nthan 4 m/s. The chick was generally resting in the feeding\narea, preening itself. The distance between the loudspeaker and the bird was ca. 7 m, this corresponding to a\nnatural calling distance of an adult (Robisson 1993b). At\nfirst, chicks were tested with the natural call of one of\ntheir parents. A few chicks (1/20) that did not respond\nbecause they had just been fed were tested the next day.\nOnly chicks whose intensity of response was ranked 4 (see\ncriteria of responses below) were kept for further tests\nwith modified signals. Thus, the population of chicks\ntested was homogeneous in motivation to detect the\n1176 ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR, 57, 6parental call. All these chicks reacted without ambiguity.\nTo minimize habituation, we tested chicks with the\nexperimental signals 2 or 3 days after testing them with a\nnatural call, while their parents were absent. We broadcast two identical experimental signals, separated by an\ninterval of 5 s, to a chick in a feeding area with a normal\ndensity of birds; then 15 min later, we broadcast another\nseries of two identical signals. The 15-min period between\nbroadcasts allowed the chick to recover its natural\nactivity. To prevent habituation, a maximum of three\nseries of signals a day was broadcast to any one chick.\nEach chick was tested with all the different types of\nsignal. The order of presentation of the signals was\nrandomized for the different chicks tested. In the same\nway, the order of presentation of experimental signals\nfrom day to day was not the same for each chick. Hence,\nthe observed responses for the whole group of chicks\ntested were neither a result of cumulative excitation nor\ndependent on playback order. To avoid a possible masking effect not studied here (see Aubin & Jouventin 1998),\nexperimental signals were broadcast only during relative\nperiods of silence, that is, when birds in the vicinity of the\ntested chick remained silent.\nCriteria of Responses\nIn natural conditions, when the parents are absent, the\nchick remains silent, lying quietly. The adult, returning\nfrom the sea to feed its chick, makes its way to the area of\nthe colony where the chick is usually located (rendezvous\nsite) and calls at regular intervals. The chick in the flock\nholds up its head, calls in reply and moves towards the\nparent, often running (Stonehouse 1960; Jouventin\n1982). The other chicks in the vicinity, resting or preening themselves, never react to the extraneous calls and\ntheir behaviour does not change.\nTo evaluate the intensity of response of tested chicks to\nplayback signals, we used a five-point scale, as follows: 0\n(none): no reaction; 1 (weak): head turning, agitation; 2\n(medium): head turning and calls after the second broadcast; 3 (strong): head turning, calls after the first broadcast; and 4 (very strong): head turning, calls after the first\nbroadcast, approaches in the direction of the loudspeaker\nand stops in the vicinity (less than 3 m). This behavioural\nscale is similar to those used in previous studies on the\nking penguin (see Derenne et al. 1979; Jouventin et al.\n1979; Robisson 1990).\nStatistical Analysis\nStatistics and interpretations of results were based on\nthe analysis of the distribution of the observed values\nwithin the five response classes. To compare paired\nsamples in more than two categories, we used the marginal homogeneity test (Agresti 1990) together with exact\ntwo-sided P values. When the same marginal distribution\nwas used through several comparisons, we used the\nBonferroni-corrected P values to assess the final significance of the test. Computations of exact two-sided P\nvalues were carried out with StatXact software (Cytel\n1995). We used a significance level of P≤0.05.\nExperimental Signals\nWe tested 17 experimental signals. These consisted of\nnatural calls modified in the frequency and temporal\ndomains.\nThe original signal\nThis signal was the natural parental call specific to\nthe chick being tested. So, for each chick tested there\nwas an original signal corresponding to the call of one\nof the parents (male or female) and a series of experimental signals. Figures 1 and 2 show an example of a\nnatural parental call. The call corresponds to a series\nof sound components, termed syllables by Jouventin\n(1982), separated by strong amplitude declines which\ncoincide with falls in frequency. The call duration\nvaried from 3 to 6 s (X&SD=4.45&1.16 s, N=66), the\nfirst syllable generally being the longest. The spectral\ncomposition of syllables corresponds to harmonic\nseries. Most of the energy is concentrated between\n500 and 2500 Hz, with a maximum level corresponding\nmost often to the harmonic (twice the fundamental\nfrequency, Fo).\nSignals with a modified harmonic structure\nWe modified the parental calls in two ways.\n(1) The parental call was filtered by low-pass or highpass digital filters (Fig. 1) by applying optimal filtering\nwith a fast Fourier transform (FFT; Press et al. 1988;\nMbu-Nyamsi et al. 1994). The window size of the FFT was\n4096 Hz (precision in frequency: ƒF=4 Hz). Four signals\nwere constructed (Fig. 1): with the fundamental frequency alone; with the fundamental (Fo) and the first\nharmonic (2Fo ); with the lower part of the spectrum\n(Fo +2Fo +3Fo ); and with the upper part of the spectrum\n(between 2000 and 8000 Hz).\n(2) The parental call was shifted up or down in frequency. This was done by picking a data record through a\nsquare window, applying short-term overlapping (50%)\nFFT, followed by a linear shift (+ or \") of each spectrum\nand by a short-term inverse fast Fourier transform\n(FFT\"1 ; Randall & Tech 1987). The window size was\n4096 Hz (ƒF=4 Hz). The linear shifts of the spectra were\n+100, +75, +50, \"50, \"75 and \"100 Hz. These values\nwere chosen on the basis of the natural distribution of\nfundamental frequency values. Except for these modifications of the pitch of the carrier frequency, temporal\nand amplitude parameters of the parental call were\nunchanged.\nSignals with a modified temporal pattern\nWe modified both frequency and amplitude modulations (FM and AM) and the syllable duration of natural\ncalls.\n(1) For FM and AM modifications, two signals were\nconstructed. (a) A natural AM was applied to a carrier\nfrequency without FM (Fig. 2). The carrier frequency was\na harmonic series and the value of the fundamental\ncorresponded to the mean value of the fundamental\nfrequency of the parental call. We applied to this carrier\n1177JOUVENTIN ET AL.: KING PENGUIN CALL RECOGNITIONfrequency the natural AM (the envelope) that was\nextracted from the call of the parent, using the Hilbert\ntransform calculation (Seggie 1987; Bre ́mond & Aubin\n1992; Mbu-Nyamsi et al. 1994). In these conditions,\nbecause of the application of the envelope, the temporal\nsuccession of syllables of the parental call was maintained. The only difference between this call and the\nnatural call was the lack of FM. (b) The AM of the parental\ncall was removed without modification of the natural FM\nand the natural carrier frequency. To do this, we used\nanalytical signal analysis (Mbu-Nyamsi et al. 1994). The\nresult was a signal with a normal FM and duration, but\nwithout any AM.\n(2) To modify syllable duration, we truncated the syllable. To prevent spectral artefacts arising from an abrupt\ngap in amplitude, an envelope was applied (by multiplication) to the data set in the time domain so as to smooth\nall the edges. As previously, the Hilbert transform calculation was used to build the envelope. Previous studies\n(Derenne et al. 1979; Jouventin 1982) have shown that\nthe broadcast of a part of the parental call is sufficient to\nelicit the chick’s response. In the present study, we\nFigure 1. Sound spectrograms of a king penguin parental call and of the four experimental signals corresponding to the same call modified\nin the frequency domain.\n1178 ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR, 57, 6broadcast signals where only the first or a part of the first\nsyllable of the parental call was present. We constructed\nfive signals: with the first syllable (Sy1); with a syllable\nbelonging to the middle of the call (Sym); with the\nfirst half of the first syllable (H1Sy1); with the second\nhalf of the first syllable (H2Sy1); and with the first quarter\nof the first syllable (Q1Sy1). The mean duration&SD\nof the syllables of the calls tested was 0.462&0.011 s\n(N=17).\nRESULTS\nTo simplify the results, we grouped response classes 0 and\n1 together as negative responses, and classes 2, 3 and 4 as\npositive responses. Effectively, it was only for classes 2, 3\nand 4 that recognition appeared clearly, with a call in\nreply to the signal broadcast. In contrast, for class 1\nresponses, chicks only looked towards the loudspeaker,\nnot particularly because they recognized the parental call\nbut more probably because they were surprised by an\nunusual (nonspecific?) signal. As a general rule, the chicks\ndid not recognize the manipulated signals as well as\nthey did the original parental call (Agresti’s marginal\nhomogeneity test: P<0.05).\nHarmonic Structure\nTable 1 shows the results. There was no significant\ndifference between responses to Fo and to Fo +2Fo. For\nboth signals a majority of positive responses was\nobserved. In contrast, there was a significant difference\nbetween the low-pass and the high-pass signals, the latter\neliciting a majority of negative responses.\nThere were significant differences between some\nfrequency-shifted signals, but they elicited a majority of\npositive responses (Table 1) except for the +100-Hz\nsignal, which differed significantly from all other signals\n(marginal homogeneity tests: +100 Hz versus: +75 Hz:\nS=25; +50 Hz: S=29; \"50 Hz: S=29; \"75 Hz: S=28;\n\"100 Hz: S=18; P<0.001 in all cases except \"100 Hz\nwhere P=0.005).\nTemporal Pattern\nTable 2 shows the results. Signals with a natural AM\nand without FM did not trigger a response. In every case\n(except one instance of head turning), chicks remained\nstationary, resting or preening themselves, as before the\nbroadcast. In contrast, signals with a natural FM and\nwithout AM triggered recognition. These signals differed\nsignificantly.\nThe broadcast of one syllable was sufficient to elicit\nrecognition (majority of positive responses). Recognition\nwas not linked to a particular syllable since it was\nobserved for both the first syllable and one from the\nmiddle of the call (no significant difference between Sy1\nand Sym). The majority of chicks recognized just the first\nhalf of the first syllable (mean duration&SD=0.231&\n0.005 s, N=17; no significant difference between Sy1 and\nH1Sy1). Recognition did not occur when only the first\nquarter or the second half of the first syllable was broadcast (significant difference between Sy1 on the one hand\nand Q1Sy1 and H2Sy1 on the other).\nDISCUSSION\nWhich Parameters Encode Acoustic Identity?\nThat the chicks did not recognize the manipulated\nsignals as well as they did the original signal, that is, the\n6 Parental call (CS)\n0\n1 s\nWith AM: without FM\nFrequency (kHz)\n6\n0\nWith FM: without AM\n6\n0\nFigure 2. Sound spectrograms of the parental call shown in Fig. 1\nand of the two experimental signals corresponding to the same call\nbut with either the amplitude modulation (AM) or the frequency\nmodulation (FM) removed.\n1179JOUVENTIN ET AL.: KING PENGUIN CALL RECOGNITIONparental call, is not surprising. The majority of birds use a\ncomplex of differentially weighted parameters, rather\nthan any simple feature, to recognize their signals. This\nhas been shown for songs (Weary 1990) and for calls\n(Gaioni & Evans 1986; Dooling et al. 1987). The king\npenguin is similar in this respect. Thus, the lack of some\nparameters even weakly important for individual recognition in our manipulated calls would explain the\ndifferent level of response to the manipulated signal.\nOur experiments on harmonic structure show that\nchicks pay attention to the low part of the spectrum of\ntheir parents’ call, not to the higher part. Only the\nlow-pass calls were recognized by the chicks. Even a signal\nwith only the Fo and 2Fo retained was still recognized.\nNevertheless, a parental call with only the fundamental\nfrequency kept was not recognized. A pure tone, such as a\nsignal with the fundamental alone, is therefore not sufficient and the addition of the first harmonic is necessary\nto trigger a response. Thus we conclude that chicks pay\nattention to the width of the spectrum of their parental\ncalls (two frequencies at least are necessary), the important part being the lower frequencies. They may use low\nfrequencies because high frequencies cannot be transmitted far in the atmosphere without strong attenuation\n(Wiley & Richards 1978) and the background noise is so\nloud that a call cannot be heard more than 16–18 m away\n(Jouventin 1982; Aubin & Jouventin 1998). Moreover,\nhigh frequencies cannot be propagated through penguin\nbodies (Robisson 1991).\nOur results also show that chicks are sensible to the\neffects of shifting frequency: significant differences were\nobtained with changes of as little as 25 Hz (for example\nbetween +75- and +50-Hz signals and +100- and +75-Hz\nsignals). Nevertheless, signals shifted 100 Hz down or\n75 Hz up still elicited a majority of positive responses\n(ranked 2–4 in intensity).\nOur experiments showed that AM alone was not\nsufficient to elicit recognition, even though such a\nTable 1.

In contrast, a\nsignal in which the parental AM was suppressed was\nrecognized without ambiguity by all the chicks tested.\nThese experiments prove that FM is a key feature for the\nrecognition of the parental call, whereas AM is not used\nfor individual recognition. The information content of\nthe FM is concentrated at the level of the syllable since\nrecognition occurred when only one syllable of the\nparental call was broadcast (signals Sy1 and Sym), whatever the syllable (the first or a syllable in the middle of the\ncall). In fact, it seems that the first half of the syllable was\nsufficient for recognition. In contrast, the second part of\nthe syllable was not recognized by the chicks. With regard\nto the FM structure of a syllable of a parental call, it\nappears that the basic shape is always the same: an\nincrease followed by a decrease in frequency. For all the\nparental calls that we have analysed, the inflexion point\nbetween the increase and decrease in frequency was\nalways contained in the first half of the syllable. It seems\nthat this inflexion point is necessary to elicit recognition.\nWhen the inflexion point was lacking, as with the first\nquarter or the second half of the syllable (signals Q1Sy1\nand H2Sy1), the signal was not recognized. The shape of\nthe increasing and then decreasing frequency of the first\nhalf of the syllable should correspond to the vocal signature of the call. These results with chicks parallel previous\nfindings with adult king penguin calls. Derenne et al.\n(1979) and Robisson (1992) performed field playback\nexperiments in which they tested the ability of adults to\nrecognize their mates. They played back reversed calls or\nsignals whose pitch and duration of syllables had been\nmore or less modified and in all cases individual recognition failed. In these experiments, the FM signature of the\nsyllable was modified. As for recognition between mates,\nthe recognition of the parent by the chick seems to be\nlinked to the FM shape of the syllable, which is repeated\nas a vocal signature on the different syllables of the call.\nAdaptation to the Noisy Environment of the\nColony\nProblems of animal communication in noise can be\nanalysed in engineering terms (Okanoya & Dooling\n1991). Two methods used in communication engineering\nare used to study sensory filtering in animals from the\nreceiver’s point of view: the frequency-based filter model\nand the matched filter model (Hopkins 1983). In a\nfrequency-based filter the output signal corresponds to\nthe correlation between the spectrum of the input signal\nand the gain of the filter. Such examples of correlations\nbetween the acoustic signal and behavioural and auditory\nthresholds are numerous in birds (Konishi 1970; Dooling\net al. 1971; Dooling & Saunders 1975; Okanoya &\nDooling 1988). In the matched filter model, the output of\nthe filter corresponds to the cross-correlation between the\nreceived and expected signals (an internal template). The\nexistence of this model is suggested by some studies (for\nexample Gaioni & Evans’s 1986 study of the distress call\nof mallard ducklings, Anas platyrhynchos). It is likely that\nking penguin chicks use matched filtering to detect the\nparental call embedded in the masking noise of the\ncolony. Effectively, signals with reversed syllables or without FM or without the inflexion point (in the FM structure) did not elicit recognition. On the other hand,\nsignals strongly shifted up or down in frequency did elicit\npositive responses, and this fails to support the notion\nthat chicks were using frequency-based filters. Crosscorrelation detection by matching filtering is known to\nbe the most sensitive method for detecting a signal in\nnoise (Lee 1960). The use of this method of detection\nshould explain why chicks are able to extract the parental\ncall even when call intensity is well below that of the\nnoise of simultaneous calls produced by other adults in\nthe colony (Aubin & Jouventin 1998). In humans, this\nprocess of acoustic recognition against a background\nnoise has been called the cocktail-party effect (Cherry\n1966) and several authors have suggested its occurrence\nin animals (Busnel 1977; Wiley & Richards 1982).\nAnother important point concerns the redundancy of\nthe information. The parental call corresponds to a succession of syllables with a broad frequency band. Our\nexperiments showed that the receiver needs only a small\npart of the information to recognize the call: chicks\nidentified the parental call with only the first two harmonics, with one syllable and even with the first half of a\nsyllable, a time period less than 6% of the total signal\nduration (230 ms for a signal of 4–5 s mean duration).\nThus the king penguin call is highly redundant in time\nand frequency. Why such a high redundancy? The background noise of the colony is almost continuous and\nwindows of silence are scarce and unpredictable, for\nexample during a 4-min recording made in a feeding area\n(unpublished data), only 15% of the time corresponded\nto relatively quiet periods and the mean duration of these\nperiods of silence was 0.6 s. The adult cannot predict\nwhen and for how long it can be heard without jamming.\nTo enhance the chance of feeding its chick, the adult\nrepeats the same information many times and, therefore,\nhas the opportunity to find a window of silence. In terms\nof harmonic structure, some parts of the spectrum are\nmore or less modifed, depending on the conditions of\npropagation of the signal, for example, distance, the\nscreening effect of penguin bodies. In this case, if important parameters, such as the frequency modulation, are\ndistributed over many harmonics, these redundant elements of information are more likely to be transmitted\nwithout destruction. According to the theory of information (Schannon & Weaver 1949), such high redundancy\nimproves the probability of receiving a message in a noisy\nchannel.\nLastly, the parental call of the king penguin comprises\nthree to seven syllables (Jouventin 1982), each syllable\nbeing separated by deep declines in amplitude which\nappear as silences. These sharp amplitude variations,\ncorresponding to a succession of syllables, are easily\ndistinguished from continuous noises such as wind or sea\nwaves. They also have the advantage of increased locatability (Wiley & Richards 1982) which in turn helps the\nreceiver to detect the signal in the background noise. This\nis important for king penguins, which do not have a nest\nsite. All the chicks responded with a score of 4 to the\n1181JOUVENTIN ET AL.: KING PENGUIN CALL RECOGNITIONnatural parental call and with a score of 2–4 for modified\nsignals such as low pass, without AM or one-syllable\nsignals. These results do not necessarily imply that these\nmodified signals are recognized less; instead they could be\nmore difficult to locate (class 4 response corresponding to\nan approach oriented towards the loudspeaker).\nWith an FM signature highly redundant in time and\nfrequency, the code of the king penguin call can thus be\nregarded as a functional code increasing the possibility of\nindividual recognition in an acoustically constraining\nenvironment.\nBiological Significance of the Code\nParent–offspring recognition by acoustic signals has\nbeen amply documented for birds, and particularly for\nbirds with nests (Falls 1982; Beecher 1989). Often, discussions have emphasized the parents’ need to recognize\noffspring but have neglected pressures for young to recognize parents (Beecher et al. 1985), especially in species\nwithout a nest site, such as king penguins. Derenne et al.\n(1979) showed that parents were able to recognize the call\nof their young and we have now shown that chicks also\nrecognize the FM signature of the parental call. This\nrecognition process supposes that three conditions are\nfulfilled.\n(1) The chick must learn the parental call. As a result,\nthe call of the parent forms a template (Slater 1989) that,\naccording to the matched filter model described above,\nthe chick correlates (compares) with each received call. In\nnumerous birds, parent–young recognition is effective\nwhen young become mobile (Falls 1982; Williams 1982;\nBo ̈hner 1990), for example the Adelie penguin, Pygoscelis\nadeliae (Jouventin & Roux 1979). The young king penguin has the opportunity to memorize the call of its\nparent during its first 5 weeks when it remains on the\nparents’ feet, and maybe before, during hatching. Each\ntime a parent returns from foraging to meet its mate, it\ngives a call for mutual identification, and this call, heard\nby the chick, is identical to the one the chick later uses to\nidentify its parent (Jouventin 1982).\n(2) The FM signature must offer a sufficient number of\nvariations to ensure recognition of each individual and\navoid confusion with others. Beecher (1982, 1989) developed a quantitative method for measuring the information capacity needed in a signature system to identify\neach member of a population with a small probability of\nconfusion. In our case, it was difficult to calculate the\ntheoretical number of possible features of FM signatures.\nEffectively, an FM signature allows an almost infinite\nnumber of combinations between temporal and frequency parameters, far more than that necessary under\nnatural conditions to ensure individual recognition in the\ncolony. In addition, there could be fewer FM signatures\nthan adults in the colony since chicks meet their parents\non a rendezvous site, so limiting the probability of\nconfusion.\n(3) The FM signature of the parents must be sufficiently\nstable during the year. The chick must learn at least one\nFM signature contained in the call of each parent and\nmust be able to distinguish these parental signatures from\nothers. This is a complex learning process. A parental\nsignature system that continually changed would be very\nconfusing for the chick. Previous findings indicate that\nking penguins do not change their calls: the temporal and\nfrequency features of the calls remain remarkably constant during the year (Jouventin 1982) and even from\nyear to year (unpublished data). Nevertheless, in some\nspecies of seabirds, the calls vary continuously. Learning\nof parental calls by chicks appears to be a countinuing\nprocess in the laughing gull, Larus atricilla (Beer 1979), for\nexample; this species has nest sites, however, so landmarks limit the possibility of confusion and facilitate\nindividual recognition.\nThe evolution of coding and decoding sounds may be\ndetermined by phylogeny or ecology. The penguin family\nuses the largest range of breeding sites known for colonial\nbreeding species: (1) burrows as in the little penguin,\nEudyptula minor; (2) nests made with stones, grasses or\nbranches as in the majority of penguins (and birds); (3)\nwithout a nest but on a site during the brooding phase as\nin the king penguin; and (4) without a nest and without\na site such as the emperor penguin, Aptenodytes forsteri,\nmoving with its egg on its feet. Since the two non-nesting\nspecies need only vocal cues to identify themselves\namong several hundred breeders (Jouventin 1982), they\nconstitute good models for individual recognition. In\nfuture studies, we intend to compare the acoustic mechanisms of identification of the nesting and non-nesting\nspecies to determine if coding-decoding processes are\nrelated to the breeding constraints of these four groups of\nbirds.\nAcknowledgments\nThe study was supported in the field by the Institut\nFranc ̧ais pour la Recherche et la Technologie Polaires\n(I.F.R.T.P.) and in the laboratory by the Centre National\nde la Recherche Scientifique (C.N.R.S.).

Playback experiments using synthetic calls showed that males tend to\nmatch the number of notes in 2-note and 4-note stimuli;\nhowever, males tended to produce more than 1 note in\nresponse to a 1-note stimulus and fewer than 8 notes in\nresponse to an 8-note stimulus. Successive playbacks of\ntwo, 4-note calls from separate speakers indicate that\nmales are likely to match the combined number of notes\nin the calls of two neighbors, even if they are not equidistant from the focal male. The results are compared\nwith the few other studies of matching in anurans, and\ninterpreted in terms of hypotheses developed to explain\nmatching in songbirds. One attractive and testable hypothesis for call matching in C. georgiana is that males\nare attempting to produce calls that are at least as attractive to females as those of rivals, without wasting energy.\nKey words Call matching · Male competition · Frogs ·\nCrinia georgiana\nIntroduction\nCompetition among males for mates takes many forms\n(Andersson 1994). Males may fight over receptive females or for territories containing resources needed by\nfemales or serving to improve detection of a male’s signals. Endurance rivalry is another important form of\ncompetition, where males attempt to out-signal one another or to maximize their participation in signaling aggregations that form in places where females arrive for\nmating. In numerous species, mating success is positively correlated with the rate or duration of signaling and\nwith attendance at display areas (Andersson 1994).\nDisplays are often energetically demanding, and in\nspecies with long breeding seasons, signaling males often lose a significant proportion of their body mass. Signaling males may also incur increased risks of detection\nby predators, parasites, or both (e.g., Given 1988; Grafe\n1996a; Murphy 1994; Zuk et al. 1998). Because of these\ncosts, we might expect to find mechanisms that allow\nmales to adjust their signaling effort according to that of\ntheir nearby rivals rather than always signaling at the\nmaximum sustainable rate.\nMost studies of male-male interactions between vocalizing frogs have focused on the signaling used to\nacquire and defend territories (Wells 1988) or on the\ntiming of the signals of neighbors, which is usually\nsome form of call alternation (Grafe 1996b; Klump and\nGerhardt 1992; Schwartz 1993). As in some acoustic insects, pairs of males rapidly alternate calls, and their signals rarely overlap; however, because of female preferences, males may compete to produce leading rather than\nlagging signals (Greenfield 1994). Call matching, another form of vocal interaction which is probably competitive, has been described in a few species of frogs. In\nthese species, the number and complexity of calls that\nare produced by a male are approximately matched by its\nneighbor. In the Neotropical treefrog, Hyla microcephala, males match secondary, click-like notes that are produced after long introductory notes (Schwartz 1986). In\na Sri Lankan species, Philautus leucorhinus, neighboring\nmales match the number of notes in calls during exchanges of multi-note aggressive calls (Arak 1983). Call\nmatching by number and song type also has been well\ndescribed in birds (e.g., Catchpole and Slater 1995;\nKrebs et al. 1981; see Discussion).\nIn this paper, we discuss experimental studies of call\nmatching in an Australian frog, Crinia georgiana (Myobatrachidae), a species with a complex mating system\nCommunicated by A.

Males of\nthis species produce advertisement calls that consist of 1\nto 11 pulsed notes (Figs. 1, 2). A previous laboratory\nstudy showed that males tended to alternate calls with an\nartificial acoustic stimulus and increased then reduced\nthe number of notes in their calls as the rate of stimulus\npresentation increased (Ayre et al. 1984). These authors\ninterpreted these results as a tactic to reduce the likelihood of call overlap. The acoustic stimuli they used did\nnot, however, simulate the natural calls of this species,\nnor were the responses of males interpreted as call\nmatching. In this paper, using more realistic stimuli and\nfield playbacks, we show that call matching is well developed in C. georgiana and that males might match the\ncombined number of notes produced by two neighbors.\nWe argue that call matching functions to adjust a male’s\nenergetic output to equal that of his rivals in order to\nconserve energetic reserves while still effectively competing for females.\nMethods\nField assessments of advertisement calls, male attributes,\nand calling behavior\nWe recorded the advertisement calls of 116 males on magnetic\ntape using Sony WMD6C (Walkman), TCD5PRO, or TCD5ProII\ncassette tape recorders and Beyer M88, M100, or Sennheiser\nME88 microphones. This total included many of the males that we\ntested in playback experiments. We measured the air and water\ntemperature at the calling site, body mass, and snout-vent length\n(SVL). We also measured the call amplitude [sound pressure level\n(SPL) in decibels re 20 µPa; C-weighted and peak or fast root\nmean square settings (RMS)] at distances of 30 cm in front of a\nsubset (n=30) of males using a Brüel and Kjœr type 2231 sound\nlevel meter with a type 4155 microphone. These data were used to\nassess correlations between body size, call amplitude, and attributes of the calls such as dominant frequency and median and\nmaximum numbers of notes per call and to set intensity levels during call playbacks. The number of males used in these correlations\nis sometimes less than the sample sizes stated here because we\nfailed to measure all attributes for all males.\nWe used a computer-based system to record the number of\nnotes per call produced by groups of up to eight males (n=67; see\nSchwartz 1993 for details). Up to eight directional microphones\n(Audio-technica ATR-55) were connected to a battery-powered interface board that sent its output to an IBM 733 Thinkpad via the\nparallel port. The output for each of eight parallel channels of the\nboard underwent a retriggerable voltage transition, of preset duration, in response to above-threshold input from a microphone. The\nduration of the output pulse from the board (7.5 ms) and the sampling rate of the computer (100 Hz) were set so the temporal resolution of the system was more than sufficient to discern individual\nnotes in the calls of C. georgiana. Data were filed to disk every\n10 min. We used custom software (J.J. Schwartz, unpublished) to\nconvert the raw binary data files into ASCII files listing the start\nand end times of the calls of each male as well as a note count\nwithin each call. These files were subsequently analyzed using\nSAS (Cary, N.C., version 6.12). The distances between males\n(n=66), their mass and SVL (n=61), and temperature at each calling site were measured after the recordings were completed.\nAcoustic stimuli\nAcoustic stimuli consisted of synthetic signals that were created\nby a custom-designed program written by J. Schwartz. The digital\nfiles consisted of 8-bit data with an output sampling rate of\n20 kHz. The acoustic properties of these signals were chosen to\nmatch estimated mean values of the following properties of samples of natural calls recorded at two temperatures (11 and 14°C):\npulse rate, note duration, note rise-fall times and shapes, and carri244\nFig. 1 Oscillograms of a 4-note advertisement call and a representative 4-note synthetic call\nFig. 2 Histograms showing frequency of occurrence of calls with\ndifferent note numbers. Values are median note numbers (A) and\nmaximum note numbers (B) recorded from individual males\n(n=67) during 10-min recording sessions\ner frequency. The synthetic calls did not incorporate the relatively\nsmall changes in pulse rate that occur within notes, nor the slight,\nwithin-note frequency modulation. The oscillograms of Fig. 1\ncompare a recorded 4-note advertisement call with a 4-note synthetic call. Calls were played back from an IBM 733 Thinkpad\n(interfacing hardware and software from Siliconsoft) through an\nAiwa Mini Compo Stereo Integrated Amplifier 16 and Sonics\nMini 7 speakers. In 1997, we also used a Hewlett-Packard 350D\nAttenuator Set to vary relative output levels from two speakers. In\nstandard playbacks, amplifier and attenuator settings were adjusted to achieve SPLs of approximately 80–85 dB at a distance of\n50 cm in front of the speaker. The intensity of the advertisement\ncalls of six males at 50 cm ranged from 82 to 88 dB SPL (fast\nRMS).\nGeneral playback procedures\nPersistently calling males were located, and any other calling\nmales within about 2 m of the target male were removed. We measured air and water temperatures near the male and chose the set\nof synthetic calls that best matched field temperatures (±1.5°C).\nOne or two speakers were positioned about 50 cm from the male.\nSpeaker orientation in single-speaker tests was in a frontal zone\nfrom between about 90° left to 90° right of the frog; the angle varied depending on vegetation and frog movements. The speakers in\ntwo-speaker tests were positioned, to the extent possible, at 90°\nleft and 90° right relative to the frog. Playbacks commenced after\nthe frog had produced several spontaneous calls, and its responses\nas well as our acoustic stimuli were recorded. After completion of\na playback, we captured the frog, weighed and measured it as described above. The microphone of the sound level meter was then\nplaced at the frog’s original position, and the actual SPL of the\nsynthetic signal was measured at that point. The SPL of the stimulus varied between 80–85 dB.\nExperiment 1:\ncall matching in response to playbacks from a single speaker\nIn September 1996, we tested 19 males using a repeated-measures\nexperimental design. A stimulus call contained 1, 2, 4, or 8 notes.\nA complete test consisted of broadcasts of two repetitions of each\nof these stimuli in each of five consecutive random sequences for\na total of 40 stimulus presentations. The order of the sequences\nwas determined randomly for each new subject. Calls within sequences were separated by call periods of 8–10 s, and consecutive\nsequences were separated by 15–30 s. The two intervals between\nplaybacks of calls used here and in experiment 2 (see below) were\nboth within the range of variation for call period: about 8 to >60 s\n(mean=27.7 s). Due to technical difficulties with the playback\nsystem during one test, one male included in our dataset heard 12\n1-note, 11 2-note, 9 4-note, and 8 8-note stimuli.\nFrom the recordings of each test, we determined the proportion\nof times a male responded to each of the four stimuli, and we determined the number of notes in the first call produced during the\ninterval between two consecutive stimuli. Using the oscilloscope\nmode of a Kay DSP Sona-Graph Model 5500, we measured (to the\nnearest millisecond) the latency of the first note produced by a\nmale in response to a synthetic call from (1) the beginning of the\nfirst note of each stimulus (latency A) and (2) the end of the last\nnote in each stimulus (latency B). One subject did not respond to\nany of the 1-note stimuli and was excluded from the analyses of\nresponse latency and note number.\nExperiment 2:\ncall matching in response to playbacks from two separate speakers\nIn August 1997, we tested eight males in a second within-subjects\nexperiment to determine whether males match only the notes in\nthe calls of their closest neighbor or whether they might produce\nmulti-note calls that matched the sum of the call notes of two\nneighbors. We also varied the relative SPL of the playbacks from\nthe two speakers to simulate two neighbors at different distances\nfrom the target male. This procedure was designed to determine if\nthe number of notes produced by a male was influenced only by\nthe calls of very close neighbors or whether males might be influenced by the calls of a nearby neighbor and a relatively distant\none. We presented males with a 4-note call from a single speaker\nas a control stimulus. As test stimuli, we presented four 8-note\ncalls in which the first 4 notes and the last 4 notes were broadcast\nfrom different speakers separated by 180°. To simulate neighbors\nat variable distances, we attenuated the second 4 notes by 0, 6, 12,\nor 20 dB. During a test, we broadcast each of the five stimuli (the\nfour 8-note calls and the control) between 2 and 28 times in a randomly determined order. Seven of eight males heard each stimulus\nat least six times. We counted the number of notes in each response call.\nStatistical analysis\nWe calculated the mean number of notes in responses to each\nstimulus for each subject in experiments 1 and 2, and the mean\nlatencies to respond (A and B, defined above) in experiment 1.\nThe data on the number of notes in each response in experiment\n1 met the assumptions of parametric statistics so we used repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA). Relationships between response variables and both body size and temperature were\nexamined with Pearson’s product-moment correlations, and we\napplied a sequential Bonferroni correction to adjust the experimentwide α-level (Rice 1989). We used the modification of the\nFreeman and Tukey (1950) arcsine square root transformation\nsuggested by Zar (1984) to transform the proportion of times\nmales responded to each stimulus in experiment 1. The transformed proportions for responses to the 8-note stimulus still departed from normality because most males responded to every presentation of this stimulus. These data were also analyzed using repeated-measures ANOVA, however, because parametric statistics\nare widely regarded as robust to violations of the assumption of\nnormality (e.g., Lindman 1974). Because omnibus repeatedmeasures tests can violate the additional assumptions of compound symmetry and sphericity, we applied the Greenhouse and\nGeiser (1959) method to adjust the degrees of freedom for each\ntest. We report P-values for these adjusted degrees of freedom, but\nreport the unadjusted degrees of freedom for each F-test. We also\ncomputed linear contrasts and used Scheffé’s multiple-comparisons test to compare responses to each stimulus.\nWe analyzed response latency using Friedman’s two-way\nANOVA by ranks instead of the parametric repeated-measures test\nfor two reasons. First, variances were not homogeneous: responses\nto the 1-note stimulus were considerably more variable than other\nresponses. Second, the variance in latency B was positively correlated with mean values across treatment groups. We compared responses to each stimulus using the all-pairs multiple comparison\nsuggested by Hollander and Wolfe (1973).\nBecause our sample size for the two-speaker playbacks was\nsmall (n=8), we were not confident in our tests of the assumptions\nof parametric statistics. Therefore, we used Friedman’s ANOVA\nand the simultaneous inference test comparing treatments to a control described by Hollander and Wolfe (1973), which we used to\ncompare responses to each of the 8-note stimuli to the 4-note control.\nIn all analyses, we adopt the conventional significance level of\nP=0.05 for rejecting null hypotheses. Because of the small sample\nsize, failure to reject the null hypothesis in some tests (noted below) is probably attributable to low statistical power rather than to\nthe lack of an effect.\n245\nResults\nAnalysis of call structure in natural choruses\nFigure 2 shows the median and maximum numbers of\nnotes per call produced by 67 males over 10-min periods\nin natural choruses. A comparison of the two measures\nreflects our impression of calling behavior in this species. When males were not interacting with a nearby\nneighbor, they tended to produce mostly 1- and 2-note\ncalls; however, during relatively brief interactions with\nneighbors, multi-note calls were commonly produced.\nThere were weak trends for larger males to produce fewer notes per call. From our dataset of 10-min recording\nsessions, we computed correlations between body mass\nand median and maximum note number (r=–0.12,\nP=0.38, n=61 and r=–0.28, P=0.027, n=61, respectively;\nthe latter correlation is not significant after a sequential\nBonferroni correction). The distance to the nearest\nneighbor did not appear to influence either median or\nmaximum note number (r=0.04, P=0.75, n=66 and\nr=0.10, P=0.41, n=66, respectively).\nA summary of correlations between temperature,\nbody mass, body size, dominant frequency of the first\nnote of the advertisement call, and SPL is shown in\nTable 1. Dominant frequency was strongly and negatively correlated with body mass and SVL, whereas SPL was\npositively correlated with body mass and size.\nExperiment 1\nRepeated-measures ANOVA revealed significant differences in the proportion of times males responded to each\nstimulus (F3,54=39.04, P<0.0001). Males responded to\nproportionally more presentations of a stimulus as the\nnumber of notes in the stimulus increased (Fig. 3A). This\ntrend is reflected by a significant linear contrast across\nstimuli (linear contrast: F1,18=68.67, P<0.0001). Pairwise\nmultiple comparisons revealed that males responded\nequally as often to the 1- and 2-note stimuli (Scheffé:\nP=0.56). Males responded more often to the 4-note stimulus than to the 1-note stimulus (Scheffé: P<0.0001) and\nthe 2-note stimulus (Scheffé: P<0.0001). Responses occurred more often to the 8-note stimulus than to the\n4-note stimulus (Scheffé: P<0.01), the 2-note stimulus\n(Scheffé: P<0.0001), and the 1-note stimulus (Scheffé:\nP<0.0001). There was also a strong negative correlation\nbetween body size and the proportion of times a male responded for the 13 males for which SVL measurements\nwere available: 1-note stimulus (r=–0.66, P=0.015,\nn=13); 2-note stimulus (r=–0.64, P=0.019, n=13); 4-note\nstimulus (r=–0.49, P=0.087, n=13); 8-note stimulus\n(r=–0.62, P=0.024, n=13). None of these correlations\nwas significant after a sequential Bonferroni correction,\nprobably reflecting low statistical power due to small\n246\nTable 1 Pearson product-moment correlations between body size\n(snout-vent length, SVL), body mass, temperature, the dominant\nfrequency of the first call note (averaged over 1–16 calls), and\nsound pressure level (SPL; measured as peak SPL at 30 cm in\nfront of the calling male).

Different letters indicate significant differences using\nScheffé’s all-pairs multiple comparisons following a significant\nrepeated-measures ANOVA (*P<0.05 for test of departure from\nperfect matching). A Mean (±SE) proportion of times males responded to each stimulus. B Mean (±SE) number of notes in response to each stimulus. C Mean (±SE) deviations from perfect\nmatching calculated as the difference between the number of notes\nin a male’s response and the number of notes in the stimulus\nsample sizes. Temperature was not correlated with the\nproportion of times a male responded to any stimulus.\nAs the number of notes in the stimulus increased,\nmales increased the number of notes in their responses\n(Fig. 3B). There were significant differences in the mean\nnumber of call notes among responses to the four stimuli\n(ANOVA: F3,51=71.54, P<0.0001). The number of notes\nin response calls increased linearly as the number of\nstimulus notes increased (linear contrast: F1,17=122.21,\nP<0.0001). Responses to the 1- and 2-note stimuli did\nnot differ significantly (Scheffé: P<0.93). However, responses to both the 4- and 8-note stimuli consisted of\nsignificantly more notes than responses to the 1- and 2-\nnote stimuli (Scheffé: Ps<0.0001), and males produced\nsignificantly more call notes in responses to the 8-note\nstimulus than to the 4-note stimulus (Scheffé:\nP<0.0001). There were no significant relationships between either SVL or temperature and the number of\nnotes in responses to each stimulus.\nSome males were quite good at precisely matching\nthe number of notes in each stimulus (Fig. 4). In general,\nhowever, males did not match the number of notes in\neach stimulus perfectly. To examine the departure from\nperfect matching, we calculated deviation scores by subtracting the expected number of notes in response to\neach stimulus (1, 2, 4, or 8) from the mean number of\nnotes in each male’s responses to that stimulus (Fig. 3C).\nThere were significant differences among deviation\nscores in response to the four stimuli (ANOVA:\nF3,51=36.02, P<0.0001). Contrast analysis revealed a decreasing linear trend in deviation scores as the number of\nstimulus notes increased (linear contrast: F1,17=62.31,\nP<0.0001). In their responses to the 2- and 4-note stimuli, males tended to produce 2- and 4-note calls, respectively. The number of notes in responses to these two\nstimuli did not significantly depart from what would be\nexpected if males were perfectly matching the number of\nnotes in the stimulus (independent t-test: 2-note stimulus, t34=–0.20, P=0.85; 4-note stimulus, t34=–1.34,\nP=0.19). In response to the 1-note stimulus, however,\ndeviation scores were positive and males produced calls\nwith significantly more notes than expected for perfect\nmatching (independent t-test: t34=2.47, P=0.02). In contrast, deviation scores for responses to the 8-note stimulus were negative and males produced calls with significantly fewer than 8 notes (independent t-test: t34=–5.56,\nP<0.0001).\nLatencies to respond to a particular stimulus were in\npart determined by the number of notes in the stimulus\n(Fig. 5). There were significant differences among\nthe median latencies to respond to the four stimuli\nfor latency A, measured from the beginning of the stimulus (Friedman’s test: χ2=42.47, df=3, P<0.0001), and\n247\nFig. 4 Oscillograms showing an example of male responses to the\nsynthetic 1-, 2-, 4-, and 8-note stimuli in experiment 1\nFig. 5A–B Box plots representing the median (line), interquartile\nrange (box), and range (whiskers) of latencies to the 1-, 2-, 4-, and\n8-note stimuli in experiment 1. Different letters indicate significant differences using Dunn’s all-pairs multiple comparisons following a significant Friedman’s test. A Latency A measured from\nthe beginning of the first note of the stimulus. B Latency B measured from the end of the last note of the stimulus\nfor latency B, measured from the end of the stimulus\n(Friedman’s test: χ2=11.53, df=3, P<0.0092). For latency A, the median latency to respond to the 8-note stimulus was significantly longer than latencies to the 1-note\n(P<0.05), 2-note (P<0.05), and 4-note (P<0.05) stimuli,\nwhich did not significantly differ (Fig. 5A). In contrast,\nfor latency B, latencies tended to become shorter as the\nnumber of notes in the stimulus increased (Fig. 5B).\nPairwise multiple comparisons revealed that latencies to\nthe 1- and 2-note stimuli were not significantly different, and latencies to the 4- and 8-note stimuli also did\nnot differ. All remaining pairwise comparisons were significant (Ps<0.05). There were correlations between\nSVL and response latency to the 4-note stimulus (latency A: r=0.62, P=0.024, n=13; latency B: r=0.60,\nP=0.029, n=13), but these relationships were not significant after a sequential Bonferroni correction. Response\nlatencies were not related to temperature.\nExperiment 2\nIn this experiment, we predicted that if males attempt to\nsum the call notes of more than one neighbor, then the\nnumber of notes in responses to the 8-note stimuli, 4\nnotes of which were emitted by two separate speakers,\nshould be significantly greater than the number produced\nin responses to the 4-note control stimulus broadcast\nfrom a single speaker. There were significant differences\nin the number of notes in responses to the 4-note call and\nthe 8-note calls with different degrees of attenuation\n(Friedman’s test: χ2=24.35, df=4, P<0.0001; Fig. 6).\nCompared to the 4-note control, males produced calls\nwith significantly more notes when the second 4 notes of\nthe 8-note stimulus were not attenuated (i.e., 0 dB;\nP<0.05) and when they were attenuated by –6 dB\n(P<0.05). Males also gave calls with more notes in response to the 8-note stimulus in which the second 4\nnotes were attenuated by –12 dB, but the differences\nwere marginally non-significant (0.06<P<0.07). Males\ndid not produce significantly more notes in response to a\n20-dB attenuation (0.25<P<0.29). Although males produced calls with significantly more notes in responses to\nsome 8-note stimuli compared to responses to the 4-note\nstimulus, they tended to produce fewer notes in responses to attenuated 8-note stimuli compared to the unattenuated 8-note stimulus (see Fig. 6).\nDiscussion\nOur playback experiments demonstrate that C. georgiana\nmales frequently match the number of notes in synthetic\nadvertisement calls but matching is imperfect. Although\nmales tended to match stimuli that had 2 or 4 notes, they\nregularly produced more than 1 note in response to a\n1-note stimulus but produced less than 8 notes in response to an 8-note stimulus (Fig. 3).\nLatency to respond was also related to the number of\nnotes in the stimulus. Latency A (from the beginning of\nthe stimulus) was constant for 1-, 2- and 4-note stimuli\nbut was significantly longer for 8-note stimuli. Latency\nB declined with increasing note number in the stimulus\n(Fig. 5B). These data are consistent with a simple model\nof calling behavior. Frogs have a fixed latency to call\nmeasured from the start of a stimulus call. However, if\nthe stimulus call is longer than average (e.g., longer than\nthe modal maximum note numbers of 6 and 7; Fig. 2B),\nthen calling is inhibited. If frogs called at a fixed delay\nafter the end of a stimulus, e.g., as seen in call alternation patterns in Pseudacris (=Hyla) crucifer (Rosen and\nLemon 1974), then latency B would be constant, and latency A, an increasing function of stimulus duration.\nMales usually called in small groups and tended to\ncluster their calls in the time period immediately after\nthe first male’s calls, an impression that was enhanced\nby the fact that inter-call intervals were long relative to\nthe call duration of multi-note calls. Experiment 2 was\ndesigned to explore response patterns to calls of neighboring frogs. As long as the amplitude of the second\nstimulus was not more than about 10–12 dB less than\nthat of the first stimulus, males tended to produce more\nnotes in their responses than they did to a 4-note control\ncall (Fig. 6).\nExperiment 2 was potentially unrealistic in three\nways: (1) the target male always heard the louder calls\nsimulating the closer neighbor first in those tests in\nwhich calls from one speaker were attenuated; (2) the\nnotes from both sound sources had the same carrier frequency and temporal properties, and (3) the delay between the last note of the first stimulus and the first note\nof the second stimulus was the same as that between the\nnotes in all multi-note stimuli (at a given temperature)\nand therefore shorter than expected (cf. delay periods;\nFig. 5). These three aspects of the design need to be\naddressed in future studies. Perhaps males are less likely\nto match the total number of notes if the less intense\n248\nFig. 6 Box plots as in Fig. 5 representing the number of call notes\nin responses to a 4-note stimulus and four 8-note stimuli in which\nthe second 4 notes were attenuated by 0, 6, 12, or 20 dB. P-values\nare for a post hoc comparison of each 8-note stimulus to the 4-\nnote control following a significant Friedman’s test\ncalls of a distant neighbor are heard first. Pilot experiments indicate that males still matched the total number\nof notes, even if the stimuli produced by the two speakers had different carrier frequencies (H. Gerhardt, D.\nRoberts, M. Bee, unpublished data), but more data are\nclearly needed. Additionally, preliminary experiments\nindicate that if the time interval between two consecutive\n2- or 4-note stimuli is increased by a factor of four or\nmore (>1.5 s), then males often begin to respond to the\nfirst stimulus before the second stimulus occurs. Males\nseemingly ignore the second stimulus and usually match\nthe number of notes in the first stimulus; thus, the second\nstimulus neither inhibits them nor elicits additional notes\n(H.C. Gerhardt, J.D. Roberts, M.A. Bee, unpublished data). Additional analyses of the calls of neighbors monitored in the field, and more realistic playback designs\nmay further unravel the complexity of male-male interactions.\nComparisons with call matching in other species\nTiming relationships\nC. georgiana males almost always wait until the end of a\nneighbor’s calls before calling. Similar calling interactions, in which one male’s signals follow the completion\nof a neighboring male’s calls, have also been described\nfor Hyperolius tuberilinguis (Pallett and Passmore 1988)\nand Rana nicobariensis (Jehle and Arak 1998). The relatively long intervals between relatively short advertisement calls in C. georgiana give the impression of distinct leader-follower relationships. We are currently analyzing multi-channel recordings of C. georgiana choruses to determine whether consistent leader-follower relationships between interacting neighbors occur in this\nspecies.\nIn contrast to the species just discussed, P. leucorhinus males show a distinctive alternation of multinote calls which, although they seldom overlap, are repeated at intervals comparable to, or just slightly longer\nthan the call duration. Inspection of an oscillogram of\nthe calls of a pair of interacting frogs indicates that leader and follower roles change during the exchange of calls\n(see Fig. 3 in Arak 1983). H. microcephala and Hyla\nphlebodes males differ from those of P. leucorhinus by\nthe precise interdigitation of secondary click notes when\ntheir multi-note advertisement calls overlap those of\nneighboring males (Schwartz 1993; Schwartz and Wells\n1984, 1985). H. phlebobes males may interdigitate 15 or\nmore secondary notes during their interactions between\nmales, which seem to add notes on a one-by-one basis\ndepending on the addition of notes by rivals. However,\nno formal analysis of matching is available for this species.\nPrecision of matching\nIn comparison to C. georgiana, P. leucorhinus, and Hyla\nmicrocephala, call matching is very crude in H. tuberilinguis. Males increased the production of 2-note and\n(less often) 3-note calls when confronted with 2-, 3-, or\n4-note stimuli, but did not regularly match the number\nof notes in the stimulus. Males are capable of producing\nas many as 6 notes but rarely do so except in peak periods of breeding activity (Pallett and Passmore 1988).\nR. nicrobariensis males appear to be more precise than\nHyperolius, but nearly always produced the same or fewer notes per call than the number in the playback stimulus (Jehle and Arak 1998). Poor matching at high note\nnumbers might result from an energetic or size constraint. In C. georgiana, the energy required for repeated\nmuscle contractions, or the volume of gas in the lungs\nneeded to generate 8-note or longer calls might not be\ngenerally available, as reflected in modal maximum note\nnumbers of 6–7 notes in natural choruses (Fig. 2B).\nPresumed call type of matched signals\nC. georgiana and H. tuberilinguis males are almost certainly matching advertisement calls. We have never\nheard C. georgiana produce distinct aggressive calls (D.\nRoberts, personal observation), but H. tuberilinguis\nmales have an aggressive signal in their repertoire\n(Pallett and Passmore 1988). The situation in R. nicrobariensis is more complex. The longer, multi-note\ncalls that are produced during interactions between\nneighboring males or in response to playbacks at close\nrange contain elements that Jehle and Arak (1998) interpret as aggressive in function. The distinctive signals\nthat are matched in P. leucorhinus have only been heard\nduring vocal interactions between males. P. leucorhinus\nmales also produce a distinct advertisement call, which\nwas heard when females approached. In H. microcephala, click notes normally follow the introductory note,\nwhich is necessary and sufficient to attract females\n(Schwartz 1986). The number of these click notes, which\nmay be matched by neighbors, tend to increase during\ninteractions between males (Wells and Taigen 1989).\nAdaptive significance\nDrawing on the literature on song matching in birds,\nArak (1983) considered three hypotheses for call matching in P. leucorhinus. First, asymmetrical matching by a\npair of interacting males could indicate dominance, as in\nmarsh wrens (Kroodsma 1979). Arak rejected this hypothesis for P. leucorhinus because each male matched\nits rival. An analysis of natural interactions within\ngroups of males is needed to test this hypothesis in C.\ngeorgiana. Large males were somewhat less likely to respond to playbacks than small males, but we found no\npattern of size-dependent matching. Further research\n249\nshould examine the possibility that a male’s size relative\nto the perceived size of a rival, as indicated by its dominant frequency, could have an influence. Second, matching might be a mechanism to direct aggressive signals to\nparticular males, perhaps even grading the response by\nthe precision of matching (Bremond, in Armstrong 1973;\nKrebs et al. 1981). Arak (1983) considered this hypothesis to be the most likely explanation for call matching in\nP. leucorhinus. For C. georgiana, the results of our twospeaker playbacks cast doubt on this hypothesis because\nmales tended to match the combined number of notes\nplayed back from separate speakers even when the playback level of the notes from one speaker was substantially less intense than that from the other speaker. This\nmodel could be tested further by playing back notes with\ndifferent dominant frequencies from two speakers. If\nmales detect the differences in frequency, intensity, or location, then they would be expected to match only one of\nthe simulated rivals if call matching is used to direct an\naggressive message to a particular rival. This also might\nbe shown by different patterns of matching in natural\nchoruses where adjacent males differ radically in size.\nSmallest and largest males in choruses can vary between\n<1 g and >6 g (M. Smith, unpublished data).\nA third, non-mutually exclusive explanation for call\nmatching is that females can better detect or prefer calls\nwith multiple notes (Arak 1983): matching is then a\nmechanism for producing calls that are at least as attractive as those of neighbor(s) without wasting energy. This\nis an attractive hypothesis for call matching in C. georgiana that can be tested by determining how note number affects the relative attractiveness of signals to females and by estimating the energetic costs of producing\nmany multi-note calls. This hypothesis is not, however,\nsupported by the results of preliminary experiments with\nfemale choice tests in the laboratory. Given a choice of\n2- and 4-note synthetic calls, females showed no preference for 4-note calls (eight preferred 2 notes, six preferred 4 notes; M. Smith and D. Roberts, unpublished\ndata), but patterns of preference might differ in tests\nwhere the difference between alternative note numbers is\ngreater.\nFemales might also simply not prefer higher numbers\nof notes beyond some minimum number, as in H. tuberilinguis (Pallett and Passmore 1988). Females of Hyla\nversicolor also show a decline in preference strength\nbased on differences in call duration once the absolute\ndurations of alternatives equal and exceed mean values\n(Gerhardt et al., in press). Clearly, playback experiments\nwith females will be essential to understand the adaptive\nbases for call matching in C. georgiana and other species.\nAcknowledgements This research was supported by ARC Grant\nno.

We would expect coding and decoding strategies to be adaptive given the constraints\nimposed by the habitat. We used playback to examine some song parameters important for information\ntransfer in the wren, Troglodytes troglodytes. Six stimuli were tested with various modifications to song\nrhythmicity, song composition, element structure, syntax and overall song spectra. Song features\nencoding information essential for eliciting a territorial response seemed to be embedded in the fine\nstructure of song elements, that is, their variations in frequency and amplitude over time. To function,\nthis strategy must be flexible enough to accommodate the deleterious effects of habitat-induced\ndegradation. All stimuli composed of original song elements elicited responses regardless of their\nother alterations. Rhythmicity seemed not to be essential for eliciting territorial behaviour. However,\nalterations in song rhythmicity, syntax and spectra affected territorial responses, suggesting that these\nnonessential song parameters do contribute to the options for discrimination.\n 2000 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour\nCommunication involves a transfer of information using\nspecially evolved signaller and receiver adaptations. The\nsignals used contain messages that may be derived from\nthe signalling behaviour itself (e.g. timing and location)\nor be coded by signal parameters (e.g. Dabelsteen &\nPedersen 1992; see reviews by Becker 1982; Falls 1992).\nHowever, sounds attenuate as they propagate and\nbecome distorted by the habitat (e.g. Michelsen 1978;\nWiley & Richards 1978, 1982). When songbirds communicate, their songs become unavoidably degraded to\nvarying extents depending on a number of factors: the\ndistance to the receiver; the respective orientation of\nthe receiver; the elevation of both the sender and the\nreceiver; the habitat and atmospheric conditions along\nthe transmission pathway; and the characteristics of the\nsounds propagated (e.g. Lemon et al. 1981; Larsen &\nDabelsteen 1990; Dabelsteen et al. 1993; Mathevon et al.\n1996; Naguib 1996; Holland et al. 1998; Mathevon 1998).\nThe often formidable task facing the receiving bird is\nto detect an incoming signal from a background of\npotentially interfering noise and to extract encoded\ninformation despite the song degradation. Moreover,\nwe would expect these challenges to increase with\nlonger transmission pathways since the signal-to-noise\nratio decreases and the degradation increases with\ndistance.\nSince long-range communication has evolved under\nthese constraints, signal alterations occurring during\ntransmission are thought to have influenced the evolution of various coding and decoding strategies. A\nnumber of studies support the idea that these strategies\nare generally based on sound features that resist degradation, thus ensuring effective transfer of information\nover relevant distances (e.g. Bre ́mond 1978; Bre ́mond &\nKreutzer 1986; Robisson 1987; Dabelsteen & Pedersen\n1985, 1988, 1992, 1993; Bre ́mond & Aubin 1990;\nRobisson et al. 1993). Information encoding speciesspecific identity is implicit for communication; it therefore follows that the transfer of this information should\nbe exceptionally robust. This is, however, a difficult\nmatter to test as processes of species recognition can only\nreally be inferred by testing discriminative abilities.\nWe used playback experiments to identify song\nparameters eliciting territorial responses in the wren,\nTroglodytes troglodytes, and we discuss these in relation to\ntheir robustness when degraded during transmission.\nWren song typically consists of a series of rapidly\nmodulated elements with a centre frequency of about\n6 kHz, features that should be particularly susceptible to\ndegradation (Wiley & Richards 1982; Mathevon et al.\n1996). In addition, wrens favour the lower levels of forest\nCorrespondence: J.

As well as its\nseemingly maladaptive song given the transmission conditions, we had another reason for choosing the wren as\nour study species. The rapid presentation of short noiselike sounds (average element durations <50 ms), often in\ntrill sequences, seems very important to our identification\nof wren song. This seems to contrast with our identification of other species living in a similar habitat, such as\nblackbirds, Turdus merula, and blackcaps, Sylvia atricapilla,\nwhere structural variations such as frequency modulations over longer elements seem to aid our identification more. We wondered whether wrens weight these\nkinds of temporal features when communicating as\nheavily as we do and if so to what consequence given the\ntransmission constraints.\nSongs consist of elements and interelement pauses. We\nwanted to test whether the rhythm resulting from the\nalternation of these two was enough to elicit a response.\nOne effect of degradation is a distortion of the structure\nof the elements. At a base level the received element\ncould be viewed as a burst of noise that, together with\nperiods of silence, constitutes a rhythm. We aimed to test\nthe relative importance of rhythmicity by comparing\nresponses to a number of stimuli, in which aspects of\nnatural rhythmicity and/or song composition were\naltered. Whilst some of these song features have previously been investigated with manipulated songs and\nplayback (notably by Bre ́mond and colleagues in the\nwren, e.g. Bre ́mond 1968), we used modern technology to\nvary single parameters without introducing confounding\nalterations to the song and we focused on song features\nthat relate to within-song rhythmicity.\nMETHODS\nTest Sounds\nWe used three songs throughout the experiment. These\ncame from three individuals spontaneously singing from\nclose (<5 m) and exposed perches in different areas of the\nstudy site more than 3 years previously. The recordings\nwere made with a Sennheiser MKH 816 T directional\nmicrophone and a Sony TCD D10 PRO DAT recorder.\nThey were subsequently taken into a computer through\nthe analogue input, digitized (sampling frequency\n20 kHz) and then bandpass filtered (2.7–8.5 kHz). These\nsongs constituted the base from which the different test\nstimuli were derived. Each stimulus thus had three versions derived from the three original songs (versions A, B\nand C). The stimulus types are shown in Fig. 1 and\ndetailed below.\nControl stimulus\nWe cut out the elements and pauses of the original\nsongs, then pasted them together in their original order\nand amplified them to a uniform peak value across the\nthree versions (Fig. 1a).\nBroadband noise stimulus\nThis stimulus conserved only song rhythmicity and\ncontained neither frequency information, carrier or\nmodulation, nor amplitude variation. A response to this\nwould have indicated that important cues are carried by\nthe song rhythmicity alone, without the addition of any\ninformation encoded by element structure (frequency\nand temporal) and/or syntax. Computer-generated white\nnoise was bandpass filtered in the same way as the base\nsongs. This long broadband noise signal was then cut into\nnoise blocks with the same durations as the song elements. The broadband noise blocks were then assembled\nin the same order as the corresponding elements in the\noriginal song. The natural pauses were inserted. As there\nwas no variation in amplitude across the elements, it\nwould have been inappropriate to equate peak values\nwith those of the control stimulus; therefore, we amplified the signal until the root mean square value was\nequivalent to that of the control song (Fig. 1b).\nFiltered noise stimulus\nThis stimulus was a slight elaboration on the broadband noise stimuli, as crude frequency and amplitude\n2\n8\nTime (s)\n(f)\nFrequency (kHz)\n1\n6\n4\n3 4 5 6\n8\n(e)\n6\n4\n8\n(d)\n6\n4\n8\n(c)\n6\n4\n8\n(b)\n6\n4\n8\n(a)\n6\n4\nFigure 1. Sonagrams of the six stimuli, shown here for version 1. (a)\nControl stimulus, (b) broadband noise stimulus, (c) filtered noise\nstimulus, (d) random order stimulus, (e) only trills stimulus and (f)\nlow-pass filter stimulus. Two other versions of stimuli were derived\nfrom two other songs. Sonagrams were created on PC with AVISOFT\nsoftware (sampling frequency: 22 050 Hz, 16 bit; bandwidth:\n161 Hz; time resolution: 5.8 ms).\n464 ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR, 60, 4modulations were added throughout the ‘song’ (between\nbut not within ‘elements’). As with the broadband noise\nstimuli, we cut artificial noise into noise blocks with\ndurations matching the song elements. Each noise block\nwas then digitally filtered following the frequency parameters of each original song element. The filtered noise\nblocks were assembled in the same order as the corresponding elements in the original songs. This filtering\nprocess introduced a variation in amplitude between the\nelements (cf. broadband noise stimulus). The natural\npauses were inserted. We amplified each signal to give the\nuniform peak value of the control signal (Fig. 1c).\nRandom order stimulus\nThis stimulus also tested the value of song rhythmicity;\nhowever, in this case we replaced the noise blocks with\nactual song elements, thus adding any information\ncarried by element frequency and amplitude modulations. Elements and pauses were presented in a random\norder, which precluded the transfer of any information by\nsyntax while maintaining the spectral qualities of the\nwhole song. The elements and pauses of the original\nsongs were cut out, then pasted together following two\ntables of random numbers: one for the element series and\none for the pause series. Each song version used different\nrandom numbers and each was amplified to give the\nuniform peak value (Fig. 1d).\nOnly trills stimulus\nThis stimulus increased the order of song elements and\npauses to some extent, whilst changing the spectrum of\nthe whole song. It consisted entirely of trill sections and\nomitted the often high-frequency intermittent elements.\nA trill was defined as a song element or small group of\nelements, repeated consecutively more than twice. The\nthree song versions A, B and C contained seven, three and\nfive trill sections, respectively. The elements and pauses\nof the original songs were cut out, then pasted together in\ntheir original order. All nontrill elements (and pauses)\nwere removed and the trills extended into the vacant\nregions by repeating parts of the adjacent trill section.\nWe amplified the signal to give the uniform peak value\n(Fig. 1e).\nLow-pass filter stimulus\nThis final stimulus was a filtered control song without\nthe high frequencies. As the attenuation conferred upon\nthe song under transmission is frequency dependent, a\ncommon feature of received songs is strongly attenuated\nor even missing high-frequency elements. This stimulus\ntested whether a change in the song spectrum and a slight\nchange in rhythmicity from the absolute loss of some\nelements and pitch change of others influences the signal\nvalue of the song in any way. We cut out the elements\nand pauses of the original songs, then pasted them\ntogether in their original order. We determined a lowpass cutoff by finding the trough in the power spectrum\nthat seemed to separate the high-frequency elements\nfrom the other elements: 6.32 kHz (versions A and B);\n6 kHz (version C). The low-pass filters were applied and\nthe signals were amplified to the uniform peak value\n(Fig. 1f).\nAll the signal manipulations and D/A conversions\nwere carried out on a PC equipped with a Signal Data DSP\nSPB2 signal processing board, using the program SIGPRO\nversion 1.3 (Pedersen 1998). The filtering used a digital\nlinear phase FIR-filter of order 63 (for details see Kaiser\n1974). A transition function with a window size of 1.6 ms\nwas used for cutting the signals, which ensured a smooth\ntransition when pasting signal parts together. The test\nstimuli were converted to analogue and recorded on to a\nHHB PDR1000 PORTADAT. The test sequences consisted\nof 12 repeats of the stimulus over a 2-min period which is\nequivalent to a natural high song rate.\nExperimental Design and Playback Routine\nWe did the experiment between 0800 and 1600 hours\nin April and early May 1999, at Strødam Biological Field\nStation and in the adjacent Gribskov forest, Denmark.\nDuring the experimental period, the weather was consistently mild with low winds. Wren territories were approximately mapped before and during the experimental\nperiod from sightings and song post locations. Each\nindividual was used only once, neighbours received different playback stimuli and different song versions and\nwe ensured that the spacing between males used on the\nsame day was large enough to minimize the chance of\ninterference by eavesdropping (Dabelsteen et al. 1997).\nWe presented all six stimuli and three versions as evenly\nas possible over each experimental day under the above\nrestrictions to counterbalance any effects of day, time and\nversion.\nAs we were testing whether the wrens responded to\nthe stimuli and then how the responses differed, we\nwanted to avoid altering the birds’ motivation before\nthey experienced the stimuli. Therefore, we did not use\nplayback to attract the subject; rather, our experimental\nroutine involved waiting at the territory until we either\nsaw or heard the wren singing. If we heard it, we also\nwaited until the end of the singing bout. Once these\ncriteria were met, we played the test sequence from a\nspeaker (3 m high) well within the territory boundaries\nfor 2 min and observed for a further 2 min. When there\nwas no response or only a weak distant response this was\nfollowed by playback of the control stimulus for 30 s. If\nthe bird failed to respond to the test and the control we\nabandoned the trial and later repeated it with a different\nindividual. This design allowed us to include trials with\nno response whilst controlling for the subjects’ presence\nin the territory throughout. Upon completion, each\ntreatment was represented by 10 successful trials (N=60).\nThe test stimuli were broadcast from a HHB PDR1000\nPORTADAT through a Vifa D26 NC-05-06 neodymium\ntweeter assembled with a 1.2-kHz (f\u00013 dB ) high-pass filter\n(Larsen & Dabelsteen 1997). The signals were amplified\nwith a Denon DCA-600 power amplifier and adjusted to a\nnatural level (Holland 2000) where a broadcast wren song\ngave a maximum intensity of 67 dB (A) from 10 m in\n465HOLLAND ET AL.: SIGNAL VALUE IN WREN SONGfront of the speaker (as measured with a Bru ̈el and Kjær,\nType 2236 Precision integrating sound level meter).\nResponse Measures\nWe noted the movements of the wrens relative to the\nlocation of the speaker, their perch heights and any\nposturing throughout both the playback period and the\nfollowing 2 min. To investigate any differences in the\nsinging responses we recorded the whole trial with a\nSennheiser MKH 816 T directional microphone and a\nSony TCD D10 PRO DAT recorder. From these data, we\nextracted the following response measures for both the\nplayback period and the observation period after playback: (1) minimum distance to the speaker, (2) time spent\nwithin 5 m of the speaker, and (3) maximum perch\nheight as measures of approach; (4) number of songs sung\nand (5) percentage of time spent singing as measures of\nsong output; and (6) (analysed separately) the occurrence\nof posturing behaviour which indicates a high level of\nexcitation. These variables were chosen in the light of\nprevious playback experiments with wrens, where discriminable differences in their responses to playback\nstimuli have been found with such measures (Mathevon\n& Aubin 1997; Holland 2000).\nWhen the wrens were silent and concealed, we\ncould not enter data for any of their locations, although\nstrong and immediate responses to the control playback\nassured us that they were within the territory. In these\ncases the trial was classed as one with ‘no response’.\nWhen there was any recordable location or singing the\ntrial was classed as one with ‘response’. These two highly\nconservative measures are used later in the analysis.\nStatistical Analysis\nThere were two stages to the statistical analysis. The\nfirst concerned the distribution of those trials with ‘no\nresponse’ over the treatments and the second concerned\nthe differences between treatments when there was a\nresponse. Rather than pooling the data collected during\nplayback and during the observation period, we kept\nthem as separate variables since there could be qualitative\ndifferences, in some of the measures, between treatments.\nFor example, a small minimum distance to the speaker\nduring playback, followed by a longer minimum distance\nduring the observation period, would indicate a retreat\nrather than a continuing search for a silent intruder. The\ntwo periods were not analysed separately, as both would\ncontain measures that were not independent from those\nin the other period. Instead of analysing separately 10\nnonindependent measures of response (variables 1–5 during and after playback), which were correlated with each\nother to some extent (range of rS values 0.002–0.87, with\n59% being correlated significantly), we used a principal\ncomponent analysis to derive a single composite score of\nresponse for each trial (McGregor 1992). The scores of the\nfirst principal component were then used in further\nanalysis. The posturing data were analysed separately. All\ntests were two tailed.\nRESULTS\nThe majority of the trials where the treatment stimulus\nwas created from artificial noise did not elicit any\nresponse (broadband noise: no response in all 10 trials;\nfiltered noise: response in 3/10 trials), whereas those\ntreatment stimuli derived from manipulated wren song\nnearly always elicited a response (in 39/40 trials;\n\u00012\n1 =39.37, P<0.001, Yates’ correction applied). This result\nclearly suggests that the noise-derived stimuli did not\ncontain cues necessary for eliciting a territorial response,\nwhereas all four of the other treatments did despite their\nmanipulations.\nWe analysed the four treatments that did elicit\nresponses further to investigate qualitative differences\nbetween them. Figure 2 shows how the five measures of\nbehavioural response varied across the treatments, during\nthe playback treatment and during the 2 min of observation after playback. The control response was characterized by a relatively close approach to the speaker, a\nlong time spent near the speaker, a high maximum perch\nheight and a high song output. The other three stimuli\nall elicited territorial responses similar to that elicited by\nthe control stimulus, although these were slightly less\nintense; the speaker was not approached as closely, the\nwrens tended to leave the vicinity of the speaker after a\nshorter period, perch height was slightly lower and the\nsong output was lower. These differences were maintained throughout the observation period to varying\nextents (Fig. 2b).\nThe first principal component derived from these 10\nvariables explained 46% of the variation and the second\nprincipal component explained a further 22%. Response\nmeasures for which low values indicated a strong\nresponse (minimum distance to speaker) loaded negatively on the first principal component, whereas those\nresponse measures where high values indicated a strong\nresponse (time within 5 m of speaker, perch height,\nnumber of songs, percentage time spent singing) loaded\npositively. Collectively this meant that high values of the\nfirst principal component indicated a strong response.\nThere was no significant effect of trial day on the first PC\n(linear regression: F1,38 =0.25, P=0.62). Experiments with\nother species have recorded changes in responsiveness\nwith time of day (e.g. Dabelsteen 1984; Shy & Morton\n1986); however, we found no such relationship despite\nrunning trials over a relatively long period of the day\n(linear regression: F1,38 =0.26, P=0.61). We used a twoway ANOVA to test for effects of both treatment and\nsong version. Responses varied significantly between\ntreatments (F3,28 =3.58, P=0.03), with the difference\nlying between the control and the other treatments (95%\nleast significant difference, multiple range test; Fig. 3).\nResponses also varied between versions (F2,28 =3.73,\nP=0.04), the difference being between version A and the\nother two versions. There was no significant interaction\nbetween these two main factors (F6,28 =1.25, P=0.31). The\nsecond principal component did not vary significantly\nbetween either treatments or version.\nThe effect of song version on the responses seemed\npredominantly due to differences in singing behaviour,\n466 ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR, 60, 4which were weighted heavily on the first principal component. During playback, song length was significantly\nshorter after version A than versions B and C (one-way\nANOVA: F2,37 =5.57, P<0.01) and fewer songs were sung\n(F2,37 =5.2, P=0.01). These differences between song\nversions did not persist after playback (song length:\nF2,37 =2.2, P=0.12; number of songs: F2,37 =1.12, P=0.34).\nWe analysed the occurrence of posturing behaviour\nseparately. The wrens postured in every experiment using\nthe control stimulus (10/10 trials). This was a significantly higher rate of posturing than that elicited by the\nmanipulated signals (posturing in 13/30 trials; Fisher’s\nexact test: P=0.0013).\nDISCUSSION\nThe stimuli derived from noise signals (broadband noise\nand filtered noise) rarely elicited a response. Filtering\nthe noise blocks to mirror the bandpass parameters of the\nrespective elements was not enough to evoke any significant response in wrens. We conclude that neither of these\nstimuli contained parameters that released any territorial\nbehaviour. The song’s rhythm alone did not code\nsufficient cues for this purpose. Given the reverberative\nhabitat favoured by the wren and the distances over\nwhich this signal must function, it is not surprising\nto find that essential information is coded by song\nparameters other than rhythm. Reverberations elongate\nelements, which has the effect of filling the interelement\n‘pauses’ with sound energy (for examples of sonagrams\nsee Richards & Wiley 1980; McGregor et al. 1983;\nMathevon & Aubin 1997). This effect is particularly\napparent in songs with rapid amplitude modulations, as\nis the case with wren song (Holland et al. 1998, 1999).\nThis result mirrors that of Bre ́mond (1986) who found\nthat an imitation of song rhythm derived from a constant\nfrequency tone did not elicit a response. A compressed\nwren song from which all interelement pauses had been\nremoved still evoked a territorial response (J.-C. Bre ́mond,\nunpublished data), which again supports the assertion\nthat the natural element/pause rhythm alone does not\naffect territorial behaviour.\nIt seems that features of the actual element series are\nnecessary to evoke a territorial response. These features\ncould be properties of the series (or part of it; e.g. length\n2\nPercentage of\ntime spent\nsinging\nDistance (m), time (s), number or percentage × 10–1\n(a)\n0 4 6 8 10 12 14\nMinimum\ndistance to\nspeaker (m)\nNumber of\nsongs sung\nMaximum\nperch height\n(m)\nTime (s) spent\nwithin 5 m\nof the speaker\nControl\nRandom\nOnly trills\nLow-pass filter\n2\n(b)\n0 4 6 8 10 12 14\nFigure 2.

However, the\nfine structure of wren song elements is altered during\ntransmission in both the frequency and temporal\ndomains. Given this, it seems unlikely that the exact\nintegrity of all or specific elements would be necessary for\nthis coding. Indeed, if this were the case, wrens would not\nrespond to any degraded versions of their conspecifics’\nsongs. A coding strategy depending on element structure\nmust tolerate a substantial degree of degradation to\nfunction over long distances through a dense habitat\n(Mathevon et al. 1996; Holland et al. 1998).\nA territorial response was given by wrens after playback\nof manipulated songs consisting of degraded (by 50-m\npropagations) elements and undegraded pauses (Fig. 4;\nHolland 2000). In many ways these signals resemble the\nfiltered noise stimulus tested here, both visually and\nacoustically. However, since this stimulus rarely elicited a\nresponse, it seems that the degraded elements contain\nadditional information to the noise-derived filtered noise\nstimulus. The filtered noise stimuli were easily recognizable to us and others working in our department as wren\nsongs. This implies that, at least in some ways, the\nprocesses leading to our identification of wren song are\ndifferent to those of the wren. It is possible the broadband\nnoise and filtered noise stimuli did not contain those cues\nessential for species recognition in the wren, although\nthis experiment tested only the elicitation of a territorial\nresponse. In contrast the random, only trills and lowpass filter stimuli all evoked responses implying that they\nwere recognizable and contained cues eliciting territorial\ndefence. This was despite their manipulations: changes\nin the rhythmicity caused by complete changes of syntax\nand tempo (random stimuli); changes in syntax and\noverall element variety both of which increased\nmonotony (only trills stimuli); and changes that introduced depletions (low-pass filter stimuli). Moreover, none\nof them evoked a response as intense as that of the\ncontrol stimulus. This implies that, although rhythmicity\nis not essential, in the sense that territorial behaviour\nis not elicited if it is altered, it is a very characteristic\nfeature of the song, which contributes to the options for\ndiscrimination.\nTerritorial responses are based on the acquisition of\ninformation through a decoding strategy that is robust\nto changes in song syntax, spectrum, monotony and\ndeletions. In the case of the latter three, this could be\nconsidered an adaptation for effective information transfer given that degradation causes frequency-dependent\nattenuation and that incorporating redundancy into\nthe signal ensures reception despite irregular amplitude\nfluctuations along transmission pathways and the chance\nof masking. Our results imply that syntax is not an\nessential song parameter for coding this type of information. Syntax is one song feature that can be controlled\nby the singer and is fairly resistant to alterations during\ntransmission. However, randomizing element and pause\norder still evoked a response in wrens, but was completely\nunrecognizable to us and our colleagues. That the\nresponse was significantly less intense than a normal\nterritorial response suggests that some information is\nencoded by syntax and that this was missing. These\nresults are consistent with those found by Kreutzer &\nBre ́mond (1986) with the advantage that we controlled\nfor song length. The only trills stimulus added some order\nto the song and the response tended to increase from that\nevoked by the random stimulus, although remained significantly less intense than to the control (Fig. 3). The\nresponse to the low-pass filter stimulus was also significantly less intense than to the control suggesting that\nthe high-frequency elements have information value.\nFrequency-dependent attenuation is likely to provide\nranging cues in degraded songs (e.g. Naguib 1995). We\nimitated a song degraded by only this process and\nobserved a less intense territorial response. Moreover, this\nis somewhat consistent with the response expected had\nthe stimulus been ranged outside the territory; a reduced\napproach with much effort put into singing (Fig. 2). This\nis particularly interesting given that the stimulus contained no other features of degradation in the remaining\nsong, for example overall attenuation or reverberations.\nThis result is comparable to the responses of Carolina\nwrens, Thryothorus ludovicianus, to the playback of songs\nmodified in a similar fashion (Naguib 1995).\nVersion A of the stimuli tended to elicit a less intense\nterritorial response than the other two versions (the\nvariations in responses did not differ between versions).\nThis seems to be predominantly due to differences in\nsinging behaviour, which were weighted heavily by the\nfirst principal component. The original songs were of\nvarying lengths (6 s (A), 4.2 s (B) and 4.5 s (C)), a variation\nthat was conserved in the stimuli versions. These were\nplayed at the same rate with one song starting every 10 s;\nconsequently more song was played back for version A.\nSince many studies have found a relationship between\nthe amount of playback and the intensity of response, the\nvariation observed here was somewhat counterintuitive.\nThe differences in response intensity between versions\ncould suggest that the original songs and their presentation contained differing information, which rendered\nthem more or less likely to elicit strong territorial\nresponses. However, these differences were apparent only\nduring the playback period and we would expect response\ndifferences caused by a more aggressive interaction to\n5\nTime (s)\nFrequency\n(kHz)\n1 2 3 4 6\n4\n6\n8\nFigure 4.

Sonagram was created on PC with AVISOFT software\n(settings as in Fig. 1).\n468 ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR, 60, 4continue after the playback stops. An alternative explanation seems more likely. A consequence of the playback\nroutine was that the intersong pauses were markedly\nshorter during playback of version A stimuli than for\nversions B and C. Wrens attempting to avoid overlapping\nby alternating their songs with the playback had less\ntime available during version A. During playback, song\nlength was shorter after version A than versions B and C\nand fewer songs were sung. These differences between\nversions did not persist after playback, which could suggest that they were a consequence of the playback routine\nrather than varying messages within the songs. Noninteractive playback disturbs the singing pattern in wrens\n(Bre ́mond & Aubin 1992) which can presumably become\nless variable once playback stops. Our results seem in\nkeeping with this explanation. As the three versions were\npresented evenly across treatments, this effect does not\nconfound the main results.\nIn conclusion, the rhythmicity of wren song is not\nan essential parameter for eliciting a territorial response.\nOur results imply that transfer of the necessary information for such a response is somehow dependent on the\npresence of the actual song elements. This, and previous\nstudies, have manipulated other song parameters without\nappearing to alter the probability of a territorial response.\nSupporting this surmise is a previous study where\nelement morphology was modified, along with syntax,\nand the response was lost (Kreutzer & Bre ́mond 1986).\nThe habitat-induced degradation accumulated during\nlong-range communication in wrens is great: some\nelements become too weak to detect and all elements\nbecome distorted (Holland et al. 1998). Any information\ntransfer depending on element structure (frequency and\ntemporal) must tolerate these changes to some extent to\nallow the signal to function at long distance through\ndense habitat. The high broadcast intensity, variability\nin element morphology and the repeated elements in\nwren song increase the chances of efficient transfer of\ninformation encoded by element structure.\nOur various alterations to the song rhythmicity, syntax\nand spectra still elicited a territorial response, although\nless intense than responses to control songs. It seems that\nwhilst these features are not essential, they are still\ncharacteristic and add to the options for discrimination.\nThis composite decoding strategy could, in itself, be\nadaptive when communicating through an environment\nwhere elements become severely degraded.\nAcknowledgments\nThis study was funded by the Centre for Sound\nCommunication, which is financed by the Danish\nNational Research Foundation.

For the analysis of the species repertoire, we used recordings of 44 individuals from 24 localities covering its full geographical range. We measured the repertoire size,\nnote duration and rhythm (frequency of note utterance), and combined these parameters with\nthe Shannon entropy values calculated for each individual. Although individuals maintain\nspecies-speci\"c recognition capacity, we \"nd a large variation between their song parameters\nand show that the information theory can be useful to analyse large and varied animal vocal\nrepertoires. We are introducing two new parameters, temporal average entropy (Et) and\nutterance frequency average entropy (Ef), for measuring such communication systems.\n( 2000 Academic Press\nIntroduction\nThere are many books on the use of information\ntheory applied to communication (Shannon\n& Weaver, 1949; Khinchin, 1957; Culmann et al.,\n1967; Guiassu & Theodorescu, 1968) and papers\nand book chapters trying to apply that theory to\nbiological problems (Blumenfeld, 1981; Kugler\n& Turvey, 1987; Weber et al., 1988; Piqueira,\n1994; McCowan et al., 1999). In this context, we\nare studying the song of birds and its variability\nby identifying the frequency of occurrence of the\nsound units, that we call notes. Those relative\nfrequencies are assumed to be probabilities, and\nthus an individual information value can be\nassigned to each note. The mean value of the\nsong information for each individual is de\"ned as\ninformational entropy (E). The maximum entropy (Em) would be obtained if all the notes had\nthe same probability.\nMost ¹urdus thrushes are remarkable for their\nlong, varied and melodious songs. The speciesspeci\"c song of the Rufous-bellied thrush ¹urdus\nru,ventris is composed of whistles and trills of\nmedium pitch (frequency range between 1 and\n4 kHz). The phrases are uttered in long sequences\nof regularly spaced notes (Silva, 1997).\nWe looked at the individual localities to eventually \"nd peculiar population characteristics.\n0022}5193/00/210057#08 $35.00/0 ( 2000 Academic PressSick (1993) reports a di!erent ¹urdus ru,ventris\nsong in Rio de Janeiro city describing it as\n&&simple and monotonous, (2) constituting a degraded form of song, a sort of dialect (2)''.\nHowever, later data of song analyses (Silva, 1997)\ndo not demonstrate song populational di!erences, in either repertoire size, notes structure or\nsequence.\nRufous-bellied thrush is a good species to\nstudy complex varied songs because it is abundant and widespread, allowing the study of many\nindividuals from di!erent localities. Like the\nmajority of Oscines that have songs with populational or even individual variations (Mundinger,\n1982; Marler, 1997; Kroodsma, 1982, 1996;\nCanady et al., 1984; Baker & Cunningham, 1985;\nTodt & Hultsch, 1996), thrushes show inter- and\nintra-individual variations. Those variations represent indirect evidences of a learning process\nduring song ontogenesis (Vielliard, 1987).\nIn order to normalize the entropy measures it\nis important to de\"ne new quantities that consider the temporal parameters of note emission in\nanalogy to the idea of necessary capacity of the\nchannel required for communication. So we have\nde\"ned the entropy average rate in two di!erent\nways: the rate considering the average duration\nof the notes or &&temporal average entropy'' (Et)\nand the rate considering the average frequency\nor rhythm of notes emission, the &&utterance\nfrequency average entropy'' (Ef).\nWe present the following measures for each\nindividual: entropy (E) based on relative frequency of notes occurrence, the mean value of\nduration of notes, the mean value of notes utterance frequency and two di!erent combinations of\nthese parameters, temporal average entropy (Et)\nand utterance frequency average entropy (Ef).\nThese analyses produced several sets of data,\npermitting to test the methodology developed\nand to propose, as a result, some biological\ninferences.\nOur goal is to de\"ne an easy way to calculate\nsingle index, that represents the variability of\ncomplex vocal communication signals.\nEntropy Calculations\nLet us consider some kind of alphabet, composed by N symbols and let us consider the\nprobability pi assigned to each symbol as a number calculated according to its relative frequency,\nobserved experimentally. Under those conditions, we can de\"ne individual information of\neach symbol Ii (Shannon & Weaver, 1949) as\nIi\"log2 (1/pi). (1)\nConsidering all the N symbols emitted, we can\nde\"ne the mean value of Ii and call it informational entropy (E):\nE\" N\n+\ni/1\npiIi. (2)\nIt is important to note that the individual information (Ii) is given in bits and the entropy (E)\nis given in bits per symbol.\nBecause the results obtained applying eqs (1)\nand (2) to our data were highly heterogeneous,\nand in order to compare individuals with di!erent repertoire size (number of note types), we\nintroduced two new equations for calculating\naverage entropy rates, as de\"ned in the following\nparameters.\nTemporal average entropy rate (Et) can be\nde\"ned as\nEt\"E\nq ]1000 (3)\nwith q being the mean value of duration of the\nnote in ms:\nq\" N\n+\ni/1\nqipi. (4)\nUtterance frequency (rhythm) average entropy\nrate (Ef) can be de\"ned as\nEf\"EU (5)\nwith U being the mean value of the number of\nnotes emitted per second in Hz:\nU\" N\n+\ni/1\nUipi.

Then, we selected the\nbest available recordings in the Arquivo Sonoro\nNeotropical, 75 recordings of 44 individuals from\n24 di!erent localities, which correspond to the\nfull geographical distribution of ¹urdus ru,ven-\ntris. The individuals were identi\"ed by a number\nfrom 1 to 44, and the corresponding localities\nclassi\"ed into four major regions as shown in\nTable 1.\nThese recordings are of high \"delity and technical quality and were analysed on UNISCAN II\ndigital sonograph in the Laboratory of Bioacoustics at the University of Campinas (Unicamp),\nSa8o Paulo, Brazil.\nThe sonograms were used to de\"ne the song\nunits that we call notes. Each note was identi\"ed\nvisually, and named with an alphabet order\naccording to the sequence of its emission. The\nnotes were then classi\"ed into sound types, and\norganized in clusters according to their shape\nand kind of modulation, allowing us to recognize\nthe notes shared by di!erent individuals.\nFor each individual, we measured the duration\n(q) and rhythm (U) of each note, as shown in\nFig. 1. After obtaining the individual repertoire,\nwe calculated the frequency of occurrence of each\nof the note types making its repertoire. From\nthese data, we calculated E, Et and Ef for each\nindividual.\nResults\nThe individual repertoire size varied from 1 to\n36 note types (mean\"14, S.D.\"7.46; N\"44)\nand the entropy values varied from 0 to 4.55\n(mean\"3.19, S.D.\"0.9; N\"44). Figure 2 shows\nthe distribution of the mean values and the correlation between repertoire size and entropy.\nMost of the notes of our sample are gently\nmodulated pure sounds.

Of the shared\nnotes, 12 (50%) were between males from the\nsame locality, and only one between neighbour\nmales (individuals 40 and 41 from Santa Teresa,\nEspmHrito Santo state).\nThe mean value of the duration of the notes\nvaried between the individuals analysed from 134\nto 356 ms (mean\"259, S.D.\"49; N\"44). We\ncalculated Et using eqn (3) and plotted these\nvalues in correlation with the repertoire size in\nFig. 3.\nThe rhythm was obtained in Hz or notes per\nsecond and the mean value varied individually\nbetween 1.62 and 3.13 Hz (mean\"2.44, S.D.\"\n0.36; N\"44). We calculated Ef using eqn (5) and\nthese values were plotted in correlation with repertoire size in Fig. 4.\nThe di!erent entropy mean values, with their\nstandard deviation and standard error where\nmore than one individual has been analysed, are\npresented according to the locality in Fig. 5 for E,\nFig. 6 for Et and Fig. 7 for Ef.\nThe localities were grouped into four major\nregions, North-east, Central-west, South-east\nand South, and the entropy (E) mean values, with\ntheir standard deviation, standard error and\nextralimital values plotted as in Fig. 8.\nDiscussion\nThese results corroborate our early descriptive\nstudy of the ¹urdus ru,ventris song (Silva, 1997)\nin its most prominent feature: its quite large and\nremarkable inter-individual variation.

The entropy has a relation with the\nrepertoire size, but that relation may be signi\"-\ncantly altered, particularly when the repertoire\nsize value is outside the core of the sample.\nThe temporal organization is de\"ned by the\nparameters with lesser variation in the song of\n¹urdus ru,ventris (Silva, 1997) and is possibly\na species-speci\"c character. The frequency of\nnote utterance represents the combination of\nSHANNON ENTROPY AND ¹;RD;S SONG 61note duration and silence interval, which means\nthe song rhythm; its variation in the sample is still\nsmaller than that of the note duration. The entropy values calculated in combination with\nthese parameters, Et taking into account the\nduration of the notes and Ef their rhythm, put\ninto evidence further individual variations between entropy and repertoire size. Besides the\ncon\"rmation of extreme individual values, these\ncorrelations discriminate more distinctively\nthose individuals forming the core of the sample,\nthan simple entropy had permitted. Interestingly, individuals depart di!erently from their\noriginal position (as de\"ned by repertoire size\nand entropy E) if we introduce one or another\ntemporal parameter. For instance, individual 18,\nwith 22 note types, presents an entropy in accord with its repertoire size (Fig. 2); in relation to Ef, its value continues near the regression\nline of the sample (Fig. 4), but not when the\ncorrelation is with Et (Fig. 3). Looking at other\nindividuals, we can \"nd the other kind of deviations.\nThe entropy values did not show any correlation with the localities of the sampled individuals,\nimpeding us to evidence any populational patterns. Even in the cases where we analysed\nseveral neighbouring birds, no similarities\nappeared, which would indicate the possibility\nof a local dialect. As the only learning process known in the ontogenesis of bird song\nis through vocal mimicry, it remains a mystery\nhow ¹urdus ru,ventris singers manage to learn\ntheir repertoire without sharing it with their\nneighbours.\nIf we are, for now, unable to say from where\n¹urdus ru,ventris singers learn their normally\nlarge repertoire of di!erent note types, we can say\nthat individual entropy values vary considerably\nfrom one locality to another (Figs 5}7). As with\nthe repertoire, the correlations of the localities\nwith the entropy show interesting variation depending on its calculation method: crude or in\ncombination with duration or rhythm of the signal (note type). A visual comparison of Figs 5}7\nwill show potentially instructive discrepancies.\nFor instance, the two individuals from Santa\nTeresa are very similar if we look at E and Et, but\nnot for Ef, whereas the two individuals from\nPiracicaba are similar for E and Ef but not for Et.\nDespite these strong variations between individuals and even between localities, an overall\nanalysis dividing the sample into four regions\nshows much less entropy variation in the South\nregion (Fig. 8). It is interesting to note that\nalthough the mean values are not signi\"cantly\ndi!erent between the four regions, the variation remains high in each, except for the\nSouth. A biological explanation we could suggest is that the southern population of ¹urdus\nru,ventris is made of relatively recent colonizers, derived from a reduced genetical or\ncultural pool, exhibiting therefore a lesser heterogeneity.\nThe large individual variability demonstrated\nby ¹urdus ru,ventris in its song needs to be\nmeasured not only by the number of di!erent\nnote types each singer may utter, but also by the\ninformational entropy it may emit. Because bird\nsong represents an acoustic signal of communication, using a sound channel for transmitting the\ninformation it carries, it becomes necessary to\nmeasure the #ow of that information. This is the\nreason what we are proposing here to introduce\nthe two average rates of entropy, both in linear\nproportion to temporal parameters: duration of\nthe units or notes for Et, rhythm of delivery of\nthese units for Ef.\nThe comparison of the repertoire size, which\ndetermine the maximum entropy that an individual singer has the potential to deliver, with the\nentropy of the song it e!ectively emits shows that\nindividuals depart di!erently from their maximum entropy, and that most of the individuals\nanalysed utter songs whose entropy remains near\nthe mean of the sample. Our data show that\nrepertoire size and overall entropy are not varying in the same proportion. A study of the rate of\ndeparture from the maximum entropy might\nreveal unsuspected patterns.\nBy introducing the temporal (Et) and utterance\nfrequency (Ef) average entropy rates, we discovered more individual discrepancies, which\nneed to be analysed in detail. It would be necessary to choose one entropy value, in order to\nestablish, together with the repertoire size, a kind\nof index of individual variation. Since it incorporates a more heuristic concept of the temporal\n#ow of information, Ef would be the best candidate. However, more comparisons are needed to\n62 M. L. DA SILVAunderstand the signi\"cance of the di!erences\nobserved here.\nConclusions\nBiological conclusions are still premature, but\nunexpected interesting suggestions can be made.\nVariability in the song of ¹urdus ru,ventris is\ncon\"rmed to be individual, not populational.\nHowever, that variability, as expressed by the\nindividual entropy, consisted of a strange pattern\nof variation: a high deviation from the mean\nover the geographical range, except in the south.\nSince the mean is not signi\"cantly di!erent\nbetween the southern individuals and the rest of\nthe sample, biological hypothesis must incorporate various theories to explain such a complex\nsituation.\nSick (1993) used his common sense to interpret\n¹urdus ru,ventris monotonous song from the\ncity of Rio de Janeiro as a dialect, but our single\nrecording is well within the rest of the sample.\nAlthough more data from that population might\nreveal some microgeographic patterns of variation, it is clear that empirical evaluations based\non aural impressions are misleading, especially\nwhen the song is complex and highly variable.\nIf we admit that the colonization of ¹urdus\nru,ventris comes from the north, the southern\npopulation could be more recent and should\nhave had less time to present variation of the\nentropy of its song. To have some idea on how\nthis could happen, we would need to know how\nyoung birds learn and disperse in natural conditions.\nThese results are preliminary but demonstrated that quantitative tools have a great potential to evaluate complex vocal communication\nsystems and to compare their informational\nstructure with biological evolutionary processes.\nWe will continue to study the ¹urdus ru,ventris\nsong database, trying to \"nd correlations\nbetween entropy and environmental factors.\nEven if, for the moment, our analysis is bringing more unexpected questions than answers, it is\nclear that the use of entropy values has a great\nimportance for the characterization and understanding of biological communication systems\nwith high natural complexity. In the case of\n¹urdus ru,ventris, we still need to develop and\nincorporate an index derived from the sequencing of the signal units. In that species, as in\nfew other birds, the song is not only variable\nthrough the individual diversity of signal units or\nnotes, but is said to be versatile for the order of\nutterance of these notes is also variable and even,\nin part, unpredictable.\nData are from M.L.S. thesis, \"nanced by Capes.\nCNPq supported the Laboratory of Bioacoustics at\nthe University of Campinas.\nREFERENCES\nBAKER, M.

Janik\nDolphin communication is suspected to be complex, on the basis of their call\nrepertoires, cognitive abilities, and ability to modify signals through vocal\nlearning. Because of the difficulties involved in observing and recording individual cetaceans, very little is known about how they use their calls. This report\nshows that wild, unrestrained bottlenose dolphins use their learned whistles in\nmatching interactions, in which an individual responds to a whistle of a conspecific by emitting the same whistle type. Vocal matching occurred over\ndistances of up to 580 meters and is indicative of animals addressing each other\nindividually.\nBottlenose dolphins show many cognitive\nand communicative skills that are rare among\nanimals. They are capable not only of generalizing rules, developing abstract concepts\nand syntactic understanding in an artificial\ncommunication system (1), but also of vocal\nlearning, i.e., the ability to modify the structure of a vocal signal as a result of experience\nwith those of other individuals (2). Although\nextensive studies in nonhuman primates have\nnot been able to present convincing evidence\nfor vocal learning, this prerequisite for the\nevolution of spoken language has been demonstrated with much less research effort in\nbottlenose dolphins (2). Dolphins are capable\nof imitating new sounds accurately at their\nfirst attempt, and they keep this ability\nthroughout their life (3). Vocal learning is\nalso an important factor in the ontogeny of an\nindividually distinctive signature whistle that\neach individual develops in the first few\nmonths of its life (4). Studies on captive\nindividuals have shown that signature whistles are primarily used if animals are out of\nsight of each other, and they are therefore\nthought to function in group cohesion and\nindividual recognition (5–7). However, because bottlenose dolphins are capable of vocal learning, individual signature whistles can\nbe found in the repertoire of more than one\nindividual in captive dolphins (6, 8).\nI investigated whether such shared whistles occur in matching whistle interactions\nbetween wild dolphins, a phenomenon indicative of their use in addressing specific individuals. Matching interactions were defined\nas an occurrence in which two whistles of the\nsame type produced by separate individuals\noccurred within 3 s of each other.\nThere is often a clear effect of observer\npresence on dolphin behavior when methods\nsuch as tagging or boat pursuits are applied\n(6, 9). I used a noninvasive passive acoustic\nlocalization technique (10) to locate calling\nbottlenose dolphins (11). This method uses\nthe differences in the time of arrival of the\nsame sound at different widely spaced hydrophones. Signals from different recording\nchannels were cross-correlated to determine\nthe difference in the time of arrival of a sound\nat the two corresponding hydrophones. The\ntime-of-arrival comparisons of three pairs of\nhydrophones then result in three hyperbolas\nof possible sound source locations. These\nhyperbolas intersect at the true location of the\nwhistling dolphin. This analysis was conducted with SIGNAL software (Engineering Design, Belmont, Massachusetts). Recordings\nwere conducted in the Kessock Channel of\nthe Moray Firth, Scotland. All data were\nacquired from the shore, so that no boats or\nhumans were present around the animals.\nVocal interactions between individuals\nwere identified by comparing the distance of\nthe source locations of two successive whistles (minus twice the maximum localization\nerror of 13 m) with the distance that a bottlenose dolphin could travel at its maximum\nreported swimming speed of 7.5 m/s (12) in\nthe interwhistle interval. If the distance between two whistle sources could not have\nbeen covered by one individual in the time\ninterval between those whistles, they must\nhave been produced by different individuals.\nFive naı ̈ve human observers were used to\nrate the similarity of each whistle interaction\nusing only the extracted contours (13) of the\nwhistles; this method is more reliable than\ncomputer-based methods that have been used\nin dolphin whistle studies (14). They were\nallowed to rate whistle similarity on a scale\nfrom 1 (5dissimilar) to 5 (5similar). The\nscores of the different observers were significantly similar (Kappa 5 0.34, z 5 16.9, P ,\n0.00001). Only whistle pairs that reached an\naverage score of more than 3.0 were considered to be matching interactions (15).\nIn a total recording time of 258 min and 43 s\nfrom seven different days in July and August\n1994 and 1995, a total of 1719 whistles was\nrecorded. These recordings were made with an\naverage of 10 animals present in the channel\n(quartiles: 7, 10, and 15). Independent counts\nconducted by a second observer from a higher\nobservation point using binoculars showed that\nthese counts were highly accurate. I could not\nidentify individuals in this study, but a photoidentification study showed that at least 14 different individuals were using this area on a\nregular basis and that occasionally groups of\nmore than 20 animals were present (16). Nine\nhundred ninety-one of the recorded whistles\nhad a sufficient signal-to-noise ratio on all hydrophones for their source location to be determined. In this sample, 176 whistle interactions\nwere found, of which 39 were classified as\nmatching interactions (Fig. 1). In both matching\nand nonmatching interactions, 80% of the interwhistle interval was less than 1 s. The mean\ndistance between matching individuals was\n179 m (standard error: 22.8 m); the maximum\nwas 579 m. Distances between animals in\nmatching interactions were significantly smaller than those of animals in nonmatching interactions (Kolmogorov-Smirnov Two-Sample\nTest, two-tailed, D 5 0.291, P , 0.025) (Fig.\n2).

The assumptions of this\ntest were that each of the 10 animals present\nhad at least one individually distinctive signature whistle type and that it could copy each of\nthe signature whistle types used by the other\nnine individuals. Thus, matching was judged to\noccur in a repertoire of 10 shared but learned\nwhistle types. These assumptions are based on\nthe findings from previous studies that each\nindividual bottlenose dolphin develops its own\ndistinctive signature whistle type (5) and that a\nbottlenose dolphin can copy new whistle types\nat the first attempt (3). Furthermore, it was\nassumed that each dolphin whistled at the same\nrate. These assumptions are conservative, as an\nincrease in whistle types or unequal whistling\nrates would make matching less likely to occur\nby chance. Furthermore, most matching interactions occurred when there were more than 10\nanimals in the channel, which also makes\nmatching less likely to occur by chance.\nThe number of all whistle interactions including nonmatching interactions was not significantly different from chance (999 runs; observed proportion: 0.18; chance proportion:\n0.18; NS). Most matching interactions only involved two animals, each producing just one\nwhistle. However, in three cases, the first animal produced another matching whistle after it\nhad been matched, and in one case, two matching interactions followed each other within 5 s.\nIn three cases, matching interactions involved\nthree individuals (Fig. 3). Matching whistle interactions were found on all seven days for\nwhich recordings were analyzed.\nWith the methods used here, animals\nswimming within 26 m of each other could\nnot be identified as different individuals.\nThus, it is possible that matching interactions\nare more common than shown here. Indeed,\n50 overlapping whistles from one location\ncould be found in the sample. However, because individual cetaceans have been reported to produce two whistles simultaneously\n(18), I excluded these cases from the analysis.\nWhistles in seven matching interactions of\nclearly separate individuals, however, also\noverlapped, a behavior that has been linked\nwith aggression in birds (19 –21).\nThese results show that bottlenose dolphins\nuse their learned whistles in matching interactions, most likely to address each other. The\ncharacter of such addressing might be either\naggressive or affiliative. However, matching\ncould also signal alliance membership to third\nFig. 1.

Fletcher1,2,3 *\nChromosomal translocations that encode fusion oncoproteins have been observed consistently in leukemias/lymphomas and sarcomas but not in carcinomas, the most common human cancers. Here, we report that t(2;3)(q13;p25),\na translocation identified in a subset of human thyroid follicular carcinomas,\nresults in fusion of the DNA binding domains of the thyroid transcription factor\nPAX8 to domains A to F of the peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor\n(PPAR) g1. PAX8-PPARg1 mRNA and protein were detected in 5 of 8 thyroid\nfollicular carcinomas but not in 20 follicular adenomas, 10 papillary carcinomas,\nor 10 multinodular hyperplasias. PAX8-PPARg1 inhibited thiazolidinedioneinduced transactivation by PPARg1 in a dominant negative manner. The experiments demonstrate an oncogenic role for PPARg and suggest that PAX8PPARg1 may be useful in the diagnosis and treatment of thyroid carcinoma.\nChromosomal translocations encoding fusion\noncoproteins are common in leukemias/lymphomas and sarcomas (1) but have been identified in only a single adult human (thyroid\npapillary) carcinoma. Compared with fusion\noncoproteins in noncarcinomas, those in thyroid papillary carcinoma occur at relatively low\nfrequency and are derived from several distinct\ngene fusion events, the most common of which\nresult from subtle chromosomal inversions (2).\nMost cytogenetic abnormalities characterized in\ncarcinomas to date are deletions that remove\ngrowth-restraining tumor suppressor genes.\nThese findings imply (i) that most human carcinomas develop through translocation-independent events, or (ii) that most carcinoma\ntranslocations are subcytogenetic alterations\nthat are difficult to detect in complex carcinoma\nkaryotypes (3). Distinction between these alternatives is important because carcinomas constitute up to 90% of human cancers.\nWe have determined the genetic consequences of t(2;3)(q13;p25), a chromosomal\ntranslocation identified in human thyroid follicular carcinomas. Three consecutive thyroid follicular carcinomas (4) karyotyped in our laboratory exhibited t(2;3)(q13;p25), which has\nbeen reported previously in thyroid follicular\ntumors, including one with lung metastases (5).\nWe first mapped the 3p25 and 2q13 translocation breakpoints using interphase fluorescence\nin situ hybridization (FISH) (6). The 3p25\nbreakpoint region was narrowed to ;600 kb\nand was bordered by yeast artificial chromosomes (YACs) 753f 7 (telomeric) and 903e6\n(centromeric) (Fig. 1A). Hybridization with\nflanking YACs 753f 7 and 932f 3 confirmed\n3p25 rearrangements in tumor but not normal\ncells (Fig. 1B). The 2q13 breakpoint was localized within overlapping YACs 989f 12 and\n896a8 (Fig. 2A) to a region containing PAX8,\nwhich encodes a paired domain transcription\nfactor essential for thyroid development (7). A\nPAX8-containing bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC), 110L24, crossed the 2q13 breakpoint and cohybridized with 3p25 YAC 753f 7\n(Fig. 2B), consistent with involvement of PAX8\nand a 3p25 partner in the translocation.\nTo identify the 3p25 partner, we performed\nrapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) using 59 PAX8 primers (8). Sequence analysis of\nRACE products from t(2;3)-positive follicular\ncarcinomas (8) revealed in-frame fusion of\nPAX8 to the peroxisome proliferator–activated\nreceptor g (PPARg) gene (Fig. 3A). PPARg has\nbeen mapped to 3p25 (9), and a PPARg-containing BAC, 321f 13, crossed the 3p25 breakpoint and cohybridized with 2q13 YAC 989f12\n1Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women’s\nHospital, 75 Francis Street, Boston, MA 02115, USA,\nand Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115, USA.\n2Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Department of Cell\nBiology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA 02115,\nUSA. 3\nDepartments of Pathology and Pediatric Oncology, Children’s Hospital, Boston, MA 02115, USA.\n*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

Whereas it has been\nhypothesized that chick-a-dee calls with different notes may convey different information, no experimental evidence has been offered in support of the hypothesis. Previously published studies suggested\nthat flock members use chick-a-dee calls in the context of moving to or from a feeding site. Here, we\ntested Carolina chickadees’ responses to playbacks of chick-a-dee calls that differed in note composition.\nPlaybacks were conducted in the field in the context of a novel food source. Our pilot data had indicated\nthat chick-a-dee calls with relatively large numbers of ‘C’ notes were given by birds on their first contact\nwith a novel seed stand. In the present study, we found that chickadees flew in close to the playback\nspeaker and subsequently took seed from a seed stand more often during playbacks of chick-a-dee calls\ncontaining C notes than chick-a-dee calls not containing C notes or than control playbacks. Vocal\nresponses of chickadees to the playbacks also differed in relation to the particular vocal signal being\nplayed back. These results indicate that receivers respond differently to chick-a-dee calls containing\ndifferent compositions of note types and represent a first step to link variation in note composition and\nordering in these calls to possible meanings.\n 2002 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Vocalizations\nthat notify group members (i.e. receivers of the signal) of\ngroup movement, a located predator, or a found food\nsource may be of adaptive value. This is particularly true\nfor species in which a group’s members are at times out of\nvisual contact with one another while they move through\nthe physical environment. Certain vocal signals in several\navian and mammalian species have been shown to be\nassociated with the presence and type of predator or food\n(Seyfarth et al. 1980; Dittus 1984; Gyger et al. 1987;\nMacedonia & Evans 1993; Evans & Marler 1994; Evans\n1997; Evans & Evans 1999). In the majority of these cases,\nthe animals possess distinct vocal signals within their\nrepertoires that are context specific.\nIn many other species, individuals communicate with\nparticular systems of calls that vary in the presence\nand/or number of note types that make up the calls. In\nsome species in which a single call system shows a high\ndegree of acoustic variability, there is an underlying\nstructure, a simple syntax governing the order of the\nunits, to that call system (Marler 1977). The most complex example of syntax governing a vocal system is, of\ncourse, human language. The rules that govern syntax in\nhuman languages result in a system that is functionally\nopen-ended (it shows ‘productivity’, Hockett 1960). Vocal\nsystems that are virtually open-ended due to simple\nordering rules have been documented in a number of\navian and nonhuman primate species and may provide\nclues to the evolution of systems of complex signals and\nperhaps human language (Snowdon 1990, 1993; Evans &\nMarler 1995; Ujhelyi 1996, 1998).\nIn avian species of the genus Poecile, a single call type,\nthe chick-a-dee call, is highly variable but possesses ordering rules that govern the sequences of note types in the\nCorrespondence: T.

The ordering rules are particularly\nwell described in the black-capped chickadee, Poecile atricapilla, where there tend to be four major note types (A, B,\nC and D) that may or may not be present in a given\nchick-a-dee call and that, if present, can occur once or\nseveral times (Hailman & Ficken 1986). These four note\ntypes obey a general Markovian ordering rule, with highfrequency A notes virtually always coming first and\nlower-frequency D notes, if they occur, virtually always\ncoming last in the call. B notes, if they occur, tend to\nfollow A notes and to precede D notes, and C notes, if\nthey occur, may occur alone or follow A notes or precede\nD notes. Because chick-a-dee calls are combinatorial,\nconforming to these basic ordering rules (while being\nhighly variable), Hailman and colleagues have argued\nthat the calls theoretically could convey a very large\namount of information (Hailman et al. 1985, 1987).\nWhereas chick-a-dee calls theoretically could convey a\nlarge amount of information, little experimental evidence\nto date has been offered to confirm or refute this (see also\nSnowdon 1993). Some observational data suggest possible\nvariation in meanings, however. Hurd (1996) found that\nseveral other species (but not chickadees) responded differentially to playbacks of the ‘mobbing’ chick-a-dee\ncall of black-capped chickadees relative to playbacks of\na different chick-a-dee call. Ficken (1981), in a study\nof black-capped chickadees, showed that individuals\nfrequently gave chick-a-dee calls upon finding food at\nfeeders. Although Ficken (1981) did not report the note\ncomposition of the chick-a-dee calls she documented, the\ndata suggested that the calls may have facilitated recruitment of flockmates to the feeder. Gaddis (1985), in a\nstudy of mountain chickadees, P. gambeli, found that the\nchick-a-dee calls given frequently when individuals\narrived in a foraging patch were different in note composition from chick-a-dee calls given when individuals left a\nforaging patch or when individuals were startled. Smith\n(1972) found that different note types within the chicka-dee call of Carolina chickadees were used in different\ncontexts related to flock movement, often when feeding\nstations were nearby. In the present study, we used\nplaybacks of Carolina chickadee chick-a-dee calls varying\nin note composition to test whether different variants\nof the calls resulted in different behavioural responses of\nreceivers.\nThe chick-a-dee call in Carolina chickadees is similar to\nthat described above for black-capped chickadees, and\nhas been discussed by Smith (1972) as being produced in\na variety of social contexts. The call is typically composed\nof relatively high-frequency A notes (‘high-see’, ‘hightee’, and related notes in Smith 1972; see also Hailman\n1989), occasionally followed by a single B note (variants\nof ‘high-tee’ note) or by one or more structurally complex\nC notes (‘chick’ notes), and concluded with lowerfrequency D notes (‘dee’ notes). There is great variation\nin the number and even presence of each note type in\nthe chick-a-dee calls of Carolina chickadees, although\nas is the case for black-capped chickadees (see Hailman\net al. 1987), the ordering of note types in chick-a-dee\ncalls virtually always follows an A–B–D or A–C–D pattern\n(Fig. 1).\nIn a pilot study, conducted in central Indiana, we\nanalysed a small number of chick-a-dee calls recorded\nfrom Carolina chickadees as they initially arrived at\nfeeding stations, and we found that a high proportion of\nthese calls contained C notes (either with or without D\nnotes following). Because C notes are less common than\nA and D notes in the chick-a-dee calls of this population\n(unpublished data), we hypothesized that these ‘C-rich’\nchick-a-dee variants may: (1) signal increased arousal on\nthe part of the producer in the context of a novel and\nnonthreatening environmental stimulus, or (2) be associated with the presence of food items in the environment.\nIn either case, we predicted that in playback studies,\nCarolina chickadee receivers that heard any chick-a-dee\ncall variant would respond by approaching and investigating the area of the playback speaker. However, we\npredicted that the receiver would take seed from a novel\nseed stand more often in response to ‘C-rich’ calls than\nwould birds hearing alternative chick-a-dee calls or other\nvocalizations.\nMETHODS\nRecordings\nIn the present study, we tested this hypothesis for C\nnotes in chick-a-dee calls using playbacks at several sites\ncontaining a novel seed stand. The playbacks included\nvariants of chick-a-dee calls with C notes (‘C-rich’ calls)\nand chick-a-dee calls without C notes (‘long-D’ calls). As a\ncontrol for playbacks of chick-a-dee calls, we included in\nthe playback design variants of the ‘gargle’ vocalization of\nCarolina chickadees. The gargle is distinct from the chicka-dee call, but has a similar frequency range and pattern\nof high-frequency notes at the onset followed by notes\ngenerally decreasing in frequency over the course of the\nvocalization (Ficken et al. 1978; collectively also called\n‘T-slinks’ and ‘click-rasps’ in Carolina chickadees, Smith\n1972). As a control for playing back vocal signals of\nCarolina chickadees, we also played back a heterospecific\nvocalization, the ‘quank’ call of the white-breasted nuthatch, Sitta carolinensis, a species that commonly occurs\nwith chickadees in multispecies flocks in central Indiana.\nAs a control for playing back avian vocal signals in\ngeneral, we also used a ‘blank’ playback, which was no\nplayback whatsoever.\nCarolina chickadee vocalizations used for playbacks\nincluded six chick-a-dee calls containing C notes (C-rich),\nsix chick-a-dee calls without C notes but with several D\nnotes (long-D) and six gargles, often used by this species\nin agonistic interactions (Smith 1972). We recorded each\nof these vocalizations in an indoor aviary to minimize\nnoise and reverberation and to standardize recording\nconditions across calls. During recording, we housed\nchickadees individually in separate 1-m 3 cages, but birds\ncould hear other chickadees housed in the same room\nand in adjoining rooms. Each vocalization was recorded\nfrom a chickadee with a Saul Mineroff directional electret\nmicrophone, placed within 1 m of the bird, on Maxell\nXLII tape using a Marantz PMD 222 portable cassette\nrecorder. We obtained the six C-rich and six long-D calls\n838 ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR, 63, 5from five adult male and one adult female Carolina\nchickadee (we determined sex by wing chord according to\nknown distributions from the population; Thirakhupt\n1985). We obtained the six gargles from three adult male\nchickadees; and the six heterospecific quank calls from\nfour nuthatches (one male and one female accounted for\nfour of the quanks; the other two were recorded from the\nfield within 1 m and with the same recording equipment,\nand the sex of the caller was not documented at the time\nof the recording). Sonagrams of the vocalizations used in\nthe playbacks are displayed in Fig. 1.\nAll of the vocalizations were obtained from birds from\nthe Ross Biological Reserve, or, in the case of two of the\nnuthatches, the Martell Forest Reserve, two forest tracks\nlocated approximately 20 km west of Purdue University’s\ncampus. This area is near the northern edge of the\nCarolina chickadee’s range and the southern edge of the\nblack-capped chickadee’s, with whom it shares some\nsimilarities in plumage, morphology and behaviour. We\nconfirmed species identity using differences in size (see\nMerritt 1981; Thirakhupt 1985) and characteristics of\nterritorial songs and chick-a-dee calls (Ficken et al. 1978);\nthe birds of the present study produced songs and chicka-dee calls characteristic of Carolina chickadees.\nPlaybacks\nAs a first attempt to test for differences in behavioural\nresponses of receivers hearing chick-a-dee calls of different note compositions, we chose to use unmanipulated\ncalls. The recorded calls used as playbacks were digitized\nusing the Cool Edit sound analysis program (version 96,\nusing a sampling rate of 22 050 at 16-bit resolution). We\nthen recorded the vocalizations onto endless loop tapes\n(TDK EC-3M) or onto nonloop tapes (Maxell UR60) with\na Marantz PMD 222 portable cassette recorder. The vocalizations were recorded onto the tapes at a rate of six\nvocalizations/min, at roughly one vocalization every 10 s.\n0.5\nTime (s)\n0.0\n0\n10\n5\n0.25\nQuank 6 (3m)Gargle 6 (7m)Long-D 6 (6f = abddddd)C-rich 6 (6f = accdd)\n1.50.0 0.5 1.0\nQuank 5 (2f)Gargle 5 (2m)Long-D 5 (5m = aadddd)C-rich 5 (5m = acccc)\nQuank 4 (4?)Gargle 4 (7m)Long-D 4 (4m = aaaddddddd)C-rich 4 (4m = accccddd)\nQuank 3 (3m)Gargle 3 (5m)Long-D 3 (5m = aaddddd)C-rich 3 (3m = acccccd)\nQuank 2 (2f)Gargle 2 (2m)Long-D 2 (2m = adddddd)C-rich 2 (2m = acccddd)\nQuank 1 (1?)Gargle 1 (5m)Long-D 1 (1m = aabdddddd)C-rich 1 (1m = accccccdd)\nFrequency (kHz)\nFigure 1.

We generated six sets of playback calls, with each set played back at\ntwo different sites (see below). In each set, we paired the\nC-rich and long-D calls by overall number of notes: in\neach pair, calls had to possess the same overall number of\nnotes to within a two-note difference. It should be noted,\nhowever, that controlling for number of notes in the calls\nresulted in the long-D calls being longer in duration than\nthe C-rich calls, as D notes are longer in duration than C\nnotes (Fig. 1). We tried to control for the possibility of\ndifferential dominance status of the birds from which we\nobtained the recordings by pairing C-rich and long-D\ncalls from the same bird within each playback set. Five of\nthe six playback sets contained C-rich and long-D calls\nrecorded from the same individual (Fig. 1).\nWe tested the playback types at 12 sites in the Ross\nBiological Reserve and Ross Hills County Park, West\nLafayette, Indiana (which is adjacent to the Ross Biological Reserve) from 18 March to 6 May 2000. These two\nforest tracts combined comprise approximately 90 ha of\nlargely mature Quercus–Carya forest (Von Culin & Lindsey\n1973) surrounded by farms, disturbed forests and the\nWabash River. To increase our chances of playing back\ncalls to different flocks and to ensure that each site was\nlargely independent, we established the 12 playback sites\nso that each site was separated from the next closest site\nby at least 250 m. In support of our contention that these\ndistances between playback sites resulted in reasonable\nindependence between sites, of 11 banded Carolina\nchickadees observed during the playbacks at six different\nsites, we observed 10 only at one site and the 11th at two\ndifferent sites (we observed only unbanded chickadees at\nthe other six sites).\nWe tested each playback type (C-rich, long-D, gargle,\nnuthatch and blank) once at each playback site, with at\nleast 4 days separating consecutive playbacks at the same\nsite. The total study was comprised of five rounds: one\nplayback at each site per round. We randomized presentation of playback types except for the fact that we\nbalanced the five playback types across rounds, such that\nonly two or three of each type occurred within a round.\nFor example, the first round contained two C-rich, three\nlong-D, two gargle, three nuthatch and two blank playbacks. Over the course of the study across the 12\nsites, each individual playback variant was used at two\ndifferent sites.\nWe conducted the playback trials between 0830 and\n1330 hours Eastern Standard Time. Before each playback,\nwe gathered 10 min of preplayback data on vocalizations\nheard at the playback site. We played back each call type\nwith a Marantz PMD 222 portable cassette recorder\nthrough a Saul Mineroff Electronics powered speaker.\nPlayback trials lasted 60 min and were broken into six\n10-min blocks. Each of these 10-min blocks was made up\nof 3 min of playback of the vocalization (or blank) being\ntested that morning, followed by 7 min of silence.\nApproximately 5 min before collecting preplayback data,\nwe placed a seed stand (post=2 m high, seed tray=10 cm\ndiameter) into the ground and placed a playback speaker\nwithin 1 m of the seed stand (we either hung the speaker\nfrom a tree or placed it on a 1.5-m-high stand). After the\n10-min preplayback observation period, we filled the seed\ntray with sunflower seeds, and began the 60-min playback period. The observers conducted the playbacks while\nseated and motionless from behind a tree or vegetation,\n10–12 m from the playback speaker. We collected the\nseed and removed the seed stand from the site after each\nplayback was finished.\nData Collection and Analyses\nWe collected data on the following:\n(1) Number of sites at which at least one Carolina\nchickadee approached to within 20 m of playback speaker\nand the number of different Carolina chickadees to arrive\nwithin 20 m of the playback speaker. We were able to\ndetermine the number of chickadees to approach unambiguously for some of the sites where most of the birds\nto approach the speaker were banded. At the sites where\nthe birds were unbanded, given that birds would sometimes approach the speaker and then leave for several\nminutes before again approaching the speaker, we chose\nto be conservative and only counted more than one\nchickadee when we saw two or more birds in the area\nsimultaneously.\n(2) Taking seed from the seed stand: a Carolina chickadee landed on the seed stand, took a seed, and ate it there\nor flew off with it to eat or cache it elsewhere.\n(3) First-approach vocal response: the first time a Carolina chickadee approached to within 10 m of the playback speaker during a playback, we documented the vocal\nbehaviour of that bird in the next 1-min period.\n(4) Total vocal production: during the entire 60-min\nplayback period (60 1-min bins of data), we documented\nevery chick-a-dee, gargle and fee-bee-fee-bay (the territorial song of the species, Smith 1972) we were able to\nhear, regardless of the distance from the playback site.\nIn our analyses of receivers approaching to within 20 m\nof the playback speaker and taking seed from the seed\nstand, our dependent variable was dichotomous (yes\nversus no; take versus no-take). To test whether birds\nresponded differently by playback type for these variables, we used the Cochran Q test, a nonparametric test\nfor categorical data for more than two related samples\n(see Siegel & Casetellan 1988). When we detected a\nsignificant effect of playback type on chickadees’\nresponses, we used the McNemar change test to determine whether there were differences between the C-rich\nplaybacks and the other playbacks (Siegel & Castellan\n1988). To test whether the number of birds to approach\nwithin 20 m was affected by playback type, we used the\nFriedman two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) by\nranks. We used site as the repeated measure for these\ntests, as well as for the vocal response tests described\nbelow, under the assumption that the response to\nrepeated playbacks at each site should be more strongly\ncorrelated than playbacks at different sites. Note, however, that there is some pseudoreplication in this analysis,\nbecause we used each of the six unique sets of playbacks\nat two different sites.\n840 ANIMAL BEHAVIOUR, 63, 5To normalize residuals from the data for the firstapproach vocal responses in the ANCOVA models, we\nlog-transformed (log (n+1)) the number of chick-a-dees\nand fee-bee-fee-bays and double-log-transformed (log(log(n+1))) the number of gargles given in response to the\nplayback types. For the total vocal production data (all\nvocalizations recorded during the 60-min of playback\nobservation), we double-log-transformed the data to\nobtain normal distributions of residuals. These transformations were needed because the distribution of number\nof calls was highly skewed. We used repeated measures\nanalysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with first-order autoregressive covariance structure (Proc Mixed; SAS Institute\n1994) to test for differences in vocalization rates between\nsites. Finally, when significant results were detected for\nfixed effects of playback type with ANCOVAs using the\nmixed procedure in SAS, we performed multiple contrasts\ncomparing the C-rich playbacks to the other four playback types. In the Results section, we report only significant contrasts (at P≤0.05).\nRESULTS\nBirds Approaching the Playback Speaker\nThe probability that at least one Carolina chickadee\nreceiver approached within 20 m of the playback speaker\nvaried significantly with playback type (Fig. 2a; Cochran\nQ test: \u00012\n4 =12.97, two-tailed P<0.05). Contrasts of the\nresponses to C-rich playbacks compared with the other\nplaybacks indicated that birds approached to within 20 m\nat more sites to playbacks of C-rich calls than to playbacks\nof nuthatch quank calls (McNemar change test: \u00012\n1 =6.13,\ntwo-tailed P<0.05). None of the other contrasts was significantly different. The number of different individuals\nto approach within 20 m of the playback speaker was\nmarginally dependent upon the playback type, but was\nnot statistically significant (Fig. 2b: Friedman repeated\nmeasures ANOVA on ranks: \u00012\n4 =8.38, NS).\nWe detected no effect of playback type on the latency\nwith which Carolina chickadees approached to within\n20 m of the playback speaker (F4,13 =0.52, P=0.72), or to\nwithin 10 m of the playback speaker (F4,9 =0.40, P=0.80).\nWe also detected no effect of playback type on the\npreplayback rates of vocalizing. For rates of vocalizing\nover the 10-min interval before each playback, we could\nnot detect any effect of playback site on the total vocal\nproduction data (F4,44 =0.78, P=0.54). Thus, even though\nCarolina chickadees tended to be more active in general\nat some sites relative to others (see Discussion), any\npossible site differences did not appear to affect our\nplayback results.\nTaking Seed from the Seed Stand\nThe probability that chickadees took seed from the\nnovel seed stands varied with playback type (Fig. 2c;\nCochran Q test: \u00012\n4 =18.53, two-tailed P<0.01). Chickadees\ntook seed from the seed stand more often at sites during\nplaybacks of C-rich calls (7 of the 12 sites)\nthan during playbacks of long-D calls (0 of the 12 sites;\nMcNemar change test, \u00012\n1 =5.14, two-tailed P< 0.05). None\nof the other contrasts differed significantly. Carolina\nchickadees took no seed during any playback at five of\nthe playback sites. However, birds approached to within\n10 m of the playback speaker during at least one of the\nplaybacks at every site.\nFirst-approach Vocal Responses\nThe first time an individual Carolina chickadee\napproached to within 10 m of the playback speaker, the\nvocal behaviour it gave in the next 1-min time period\ndepended upon the playback type (F4,7 =7.13, P=0.013).\nHowever, the response to C-rich calls was not statistically\ndifferent from the response to long-D calls for this\nresponse variable.

Furthermore, receivers produced\nsignificantly more chick-a-dees during C-rich playbacks\nthan during gargle playbacks (Fig. 3a; F1,7 =6.61,\nP=0.037). There was a significant effect of playback type\non fee-bee-fee-bay rates in the first-approach vocal\nresponse data (F4,7 =4.63, P=0.038). Contrast analyses\nindicated that playbacks of gargles evoked significantly\nmore fee-bee-fee-bays than did playbacks of C-rich calls\n(Fig. 3b; F1,7 =14.94, P=0.006). The rate at which\napproaching chickadees produced gargles was unaffected\nby playback type (Fig. 3c; F4,7 =0.75, P=0.590).\nThe time of day at which each playback was started was\nfound to have a significant effect on the chick-a-dee rates\nof receivers (F1,11 =5.35, P=0.04). Carolina chickadees\ngave fewer chick-a-dees in their first-approach vocal\nresponses the later in the morning the playback test\nbegan, across all playback types.\nTotal Vocal Production\nAs was the case with first-approach vocal responses, the\nplayback type affected total vocal production during\nthe entire 60-min playback interval. We found significant\neffects of playback type on chick-a-dee rates (F4,43 =4.72,\nP=0.003) and on fee-bee-fee-bay rates (F4,43 =6.42,\nP=0.001). However, unlike the first-approach vocal\nresponses, the chickadees’ vocal response to C-rich calls\ndiffered significantly from their response to long-D calls.\nContrast analyses for chick-a-dee responses in the total\nvocal production data indicated that chickadees produced more chick-a-dees during playbacks of C-rich calls\nthan during the four other playback types (Fig. 4a; blank:\nF1,43 =6.29, P=0.016; nuthatch: F1,43 =17.74, P=0.0001;\ngargle: F1,43 =5.82, P=0.020; long-D: F1,43 =9.29, P=\n0.004). Contrast analyses for fee-bee-fee-bay responses\nindicated that fee-bee-fee-bays were given to playbacks of\ngargles more often than to C-rich playbacks (Fig. 4b;\nF1,43 =11.12, P=0.002). We found no effect of playback\ntype on gargle rates, as was the case for the first-approach\nvocal responses (Fig. 4c; F4,43 =1.44, P=0.236).\n0\n12\nPlayback type\n(c)\nBlank Nuthatch Gargle Long-D C-rich\n8\n4\n0\n12\n(b)\nVocalizations (N/min)\n8\n4\n0\n12\n(a)\n8\n4\nFigure 3.

Among several potentially adaptive\nreasons for forming flocks, the greater numbers of individuals may increase the possibility of detecting food\nresources on the flock’s territory (Lucas et al. 1999). For\nthis to be true, an individual locating a novel food source\nwould need to be able to communicate some information\nto flockmates. One of the most efficient means of communicating over potentially large distances and out of\nvisual contact is through acoustic signalling (Bradbury &\nVehrencamp 1998). Previous work with different species\nof chickadees suggested the possibility that different variants of the chick-a-dee vocal system might be associated\nwith the presence of different environmental stimuli or\nmotivational states of the signaller (Smith 1972; Gaddis\n1985; Ficken et al. 1994). In the present study, the\nnumber of sites at which Carolina chickadees approached\nwithin 20 m of the playback speaker was dependent upon\nthe type of call being broadcast, with calls containing C\nnotes (C-rich calls) eliciting approach more often than\nany other call type. Birds subsequently took seed from\nseed stands during playbacks of C-rich calls more often\nthan they did during playbacks of chick-a-dee calls that\ndid not contain C notes (long-D calls). Indeed, across the\n12 playback sites, Carolina chickadees never took a seed\nfrom the seed stand during a playback of a long-D call.\nIn addition to the data on taking seeds, we found\nresponse differences between C-rich and long-D chick-adee playbacks in the total vocal production data. We\nobserved more chick-a-dee calls during the 60-min playback trial when the playback was a C-rich call than when\nit was any other playback type. A possible explanation for\nthis is that birds approaching the playback speaker closely\nin response to C-rich playbacks, and subsequently taking\nseed, tended to return again and again to the stand. Thus,\nthe observed increased chick-a-dee rates to C-rich call\nplaybacks may have been a consequence of slightly more\nchickadees in the area (although we did not detect significant differences among playback types for the number of\nbirds approaching the playback speaker). Taken together,\nthe data on taking seed and total vocal production indicate that C-rich and long-D calls produce different vocal\nand approach responses in receivers.\nOne interpretation of our results is that calls containing\nC notes convey some information about the presence of\nfood and that the location of the signaller would provide\ninformation about the location of the food. Thus, the\ncontext in which the signal is given likely is important to\nreceivers as well as the signal itself (Smith 1968; Leger\n1993). The C-rich calls cannot be considered truly referential signals (see Evans 1997), referring exclusively to\nfood, because they are used in nonfood contexts, as are\nother variants of chick-a-dee calls (Smith 1972; Ficken et\nal. 1978; Gaddis 1985). A relatively high number of C\nnotes in a chick-a-dee call may, however, be probabilistically associated with the presence of a rich food resource\nin the environment. Another interpretation of these\nresults is that chick-a-dee calls with a relatively high\nnumber of C notes may signal novelty or a high motivation level on the part of the producer in the context of\na novel but nonthreatening environmental stimulus (a\nlarge amount of seed on the seed stand). In this sense, the\nC-rich calls in the present study would conform to ideas\nabout note composition, motivation and flock member\nmovement conveyed by earlier work with chick-a-dee\ncalls (Smith 1972; Hailman et al. 1985). Indeed, we might\nexpect a call system that exhibits nondiscrete variation\n(such as the chick-a-dee call system, where C-rich calls\ncould contain, for example, 3, 6, or even 10 C notes)\nto convey information about graded changes in the\nmotivation of the producer (Owings & Morton 1998).\nFive of our playback sites occurred within an area of the\nRoss Biological Reserve that has had permanent seed\nstands in place for over a decade, although the specific\nsites we used for our seed stands never had permanent\nseed stands. Carolina chickadees approached and subsequently took seeds during playbacks of C-rich calls at all\nfive of these playback sites, but did so only at two of the\nseven sites not near permanent seed stands. Chickadees\nnever took seed during playbacks of long-D calls, regardless of playback site (note that we played back all five\nplayback types at each of the 12 playback sites). While\nthis is a small sample, the results suggest that C-rich\nchick-a-dee calls may be most effective at producing\nseed-taking behaviour on the part of receivers in contexts\nin which the birds are already used to obtaining seed on\nstands, whereas long-D calls are ineffective at producing\nseed-taking behaviour irrespective of the feeding history\nof the birds in the population.\nIt has been suggested that the ratio of D notes to other\nnote types may convey information in chick-a-dee calls\n(Hailman et al. 1987). In other words, few or no D notes\nmay convey a different meaning to a receiver than would\nmany D notes, regardless of the presence of C notes in the\ncalls. Under this interpretation, playbacks of the C-rich\ncalls at the seed stands, because they had relatively few D\nnotes, may have been acted on by responding individuals\nas a signal indicating a novel but not agonistic context.\nEach of the C-rich and long-D calls (and gargles) were\nprobably perceived by responding individuals as coming\nfrom nonflock members, as all of the playback calls were\nrecorded from individuals that differed from those to\nwhich the calls were played back. Long-D calls may have\nbeen perceived as being aggressive or antagonistic, while\nC-rich calls with few or no D notes may not have been\nperceived as such, and the increased propensity to\napproach the speaker and seed stand may have simply\nbeen an incidental by-product of this. Further work is\nneeded to clarify this issue.\nThis study represents a first step to determine whether\nchick-a-dee calls that vary in note composition have\ndifferent meanings. We have focused on certain chick-adee call variants and possible differences in meaning from\nthe standpoint of the signal receiver, the assessment side\nof the communication system (Owings & Morton 1998).\n843FREEBERG & LUCAS: RESPONDING TO CHICK-A-DEE CALLSFuture work will need to address more closely the management side of the communication system, focusing on\nthe specific contexts in which calls varying in note\ncomposition (such as C-rich or long-D variants) are\nproduced. Furthermore, future work will need to look\nmore closely at how combinations of signals that vary in\nnote composition are used by chickadees in different\ncontexts (see Smith 1991; Leger 1993). It seems possible\nthat both note composition of individual calls and the\nordering of chick-a-dee calls in a calling sequence of a\nbird might depend upon the relationships between the\nsignaller and receivers, as well as upon whether the\ncontexts of the vocalizations were food, a predator, an\naggressive interaction, or the movement of the signaller.\nFor example, in flycatchers in the genus Sayornis, different vocal types are used in different social contexts, and\nthe ‘string lengths’ of vocal types (number of repetitions\nof a particular vocal type before the bird switches to\nanother vocal type) predict a bird’s subsequent behaviour\n(Smith 1969, 1970). Shifts between different vocal types\nare also predictive of behaviour in great crested flycatchers, Myiarchus crinitus (Smith & Smith 1996a, b).\nThe results of the present study support the suggestion\nof Ficken et al. (1994) that contextual differences in\nchick-a-dee call use vary considerably among chickadee\nspecies. In the Mexican chickadee, P. sclateri, birds produce calls with a relatively high number of C notes when\nnear a playback speaker broadcasting predator calls\n(Ficken et al. 1994). Thus, in the Mexican chickadee, C\nnotes appear to be used more in a predator mobbing\ncontext or when the birds are in a disturbed situation.\nHowever, strings of D notes appear to take on those\nfunctions in black-capped chickadees (Apel 1985, cited in\nFicken et al. 1994), and possibly Carolina chickadees (J. R.\nLucas & M. Lorenz, unpublished data). The C note has\nbeen suggested to function in flock movement in blackcapped chickadees (Hailman et al. 1985) and when birds\nleave a foraging patch in mountain chickadees (classified\nas Category II calls containing B elements in Gaddis\n1985). Phylogenies based on mitochondrial DNA comparisons place Carolina chickadees close to the blackcapped chickadee and mountain chickadee clade, and\nmore distantly to Mexican chickadees (Gill et al. 1993).\nThe admittedly small amount of empirical data thus far\nsuggests that note type and context relationships of the\nchick-a-dee call in these four species correlate with these\nphylogenetic differences; more comparative research on\nthis call system in these and other Poecile species is\nneeded to understand these relationships better.\nThe hypothetical amount of information that could\nbe conveyed in the chick-a-dee call system is immense\n(Hailman et al. 1985). This study provides the first experimental data in chickadee species to indicate that chicka-dee calls differing in terms of their note composition\ncan also differ in terms of their meaning to receivers.\nTogether with the question of note composition relationships to possible meanings in chick-a-dee calls, the fact\nthat characteristics of this call system, like human language, are learned (Nowicki 1989; Hughes et al. 1998)\nsuggests that this system may represent an informative\nanalogue to human language.\nAcknowledgments\nWe wish to thank Amber Cicotte, Amanda Jaurige and\nJulia Lapenta for assistance with data collection.

BAKER'\"2 AND APRIL M. BECKER'\nABSTRACT.-Many animals advertise the presence of a predator threat through vocal signals. Black-capped\nChickadees (Poecile atricapilla) use their chick-a-dee call as a mobbing call when encountering a perched hawk\nor owl. This social signal appears to serve as an alert to other chickadees, causing them to rally to the vicinity\nof the predator and join in a chorus of calling. We asked the question: do chickadees vary the mobbing call in\na manner that could convey the immediacy of threat from a potential predator? We examined the responses of\nchickadees to a taxidermic mount of an avian predator presented at distances of I m and 6 m from each subject.\nVocal responses were recorded and analyzed for response latency, calling rate, and syllable composition of calls.\nDuring 5-min trials, the subjects responded more quickly and produced significantly more chick-a-dee calls for\npredator presentations at the 1-m distance than at the 6-m distance. Alterations of syllable composition of the\ncall also were observed under the two treatments. These results suggest that information about the immediacy\nof threat or proximity of a predator may be signaled by alteration of the rate of calling, with possible additional\ninformation contained in proportional changes in the different syllable types of the call. Studies of referential\n(symbolic) communication in birds and mammals often have failed to consider the problem of response urgency\nseparately from predator-type labeling in vocal signal design. Received 14 June 2002, accepted 16 October 2002.\nThe antipredator vocal signaling behavior\nof birds and mammals offers important re-\nsearch opportunities in the functional analysis\nof animal communication systems. Observa-\ntions of the utterances of warning calls or\nmobbing calls in the presence of predators\nraises questions about the nature of the infor-\nmation content of such vocal signals. If a vo-\ncalization contains variations that inform re-\ncipients about environmental events, such as\nthe presence of a predator, the signal is ref-\nerential (Evans 1997). Mammalian studies, es-\npecially of primates, call our attention to ques-\ntions about the cognitive processes involved\nin signals that employ acoustically distinct,\npredator-type-specific calls (Seyfarth et al.\n1980, Macedonia 1990, Zuberbuhler 2000,\nManser 2001, Fichtel and Kappeler 2002).\nThe difficulty in obtaining unequivocal evi-\ndence for representational cognition in anti-\npredator signaling has led to the notion of\n\"functional reference,\" which directs efforts\ntoward issues that are possible to address by\nexperimental approaches (Marler et al. 1992,\nEvans 1997). The concept of functionally ref-\nerential communication causes one to examine\nbehavioral response to vocal signals, testing\nthe hypothesis that the signals encode infor-\nmation about environmental events, whether a\nresponse to the signal is mediated by internal\nrepresentation or not (Marler et al. 1992).\nA problem often arising in the interpreta-\ntions of predator signaling is the discrimina-\ntion of predator class labeling from the im-\nmediacy of the predation threat. Two different\nkinds of signals might be used by small birds:\none for a raptor circling overhead and a dif-\nferent one for an approaching fox, but these\ntwo kinds of predators differ also in the ur-\ngency of response required of the prey. Few\nstudies have examined the possible separate\neffects of predator type and response urgency\n(Pereira and Macedonia 1991, Manser 2001).\nMarler et al. (1992) cast the issue in an im-\nportant light by arguing that antipredator calls\nusually will contain both motivational (e.g.,\nurgency) information as well as information\nabout kind of predator stimulus, with the rel-\native amounts of the two types of information\nlying on a continuum.\nIt was this latter hypothesis that led us to\nthe present study. Well described in the liter-\nature is the variable call of the Black-capped\nChickadee (Poecile atricapilla), the familiar\nchick-a-dee call, from which the species gets\nits common name. This call is multifunctional,\ncontaining information on flock identity, pop-\nulation identity, and location, but it also\nserves as a predator mobbing call (Ficken et\nal. 1978, Apel 1985, Smith 1991, Ficken and\n' Biology Dept., Colorado State Univ., Fort Collins,\nCO 80523, USA.\n2 Corresponding author; E-mail:\nmcbaker@ lamar.colostate.edu\n510\nThis content downloaded from\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n129.2.89.26 on Tue, 13 Jan 2026 21:24:52 UTC��������������\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/termsBaker and Becker * CHICKADEE MOBBING CALLS 511\n101 AKBC C C: C S1D\n10-~-\n0.5s\nFIG. 1. This chick-a-dee call of the Black-capped Chickadee illustrates the four types of syllables (A, B, C,\nD) usually contained in the call. Each type of syllable can vary in number and this was quantified in calls given\nby subjects when stimulated by a mount of a Prairie Falcon presented at I m and 6 m distances.\nPopp 1996, Hurd 1996). During mobbing\nevents, chick-a-dee calls are produced as one\nor more birds approach a predator in a gradual\nmanner, with frequent changes of position,\nand sometimes attack and dive at the predator,\nwhich may induce it to move. Other conspe-\ncifics as well as other species are attracted to\nthe site of mobbing. This \"harassment\" func-\ntion of mobbing calls has been noted in nu-\nmerous species of birds (Klump and Shalter\n1984, Ficken and Popp 1996).\nThe chick-a-dee call seems well designed\nfor many functions, at least potentially, be-\ncause the acoustic units that constitute the\nwhole call, the syllables or notes, can combine\nin various ways numerically to form a very\nlarge set of different call types. Although vir-\ntually all chick-a-dee calls observe the se-\nquential delivery of the four types of syllable\nin the most complete form of the call (syllable\nsequence A-4B->C->D; Fig. 1), one or more\nsyllable types can be deleted, or produced in\ndiffering numbers, indicating a combinatorial\nsignal that has been likened to syntax struc-\ntures in written language in which letters are\nrecombined to form a variety of different\nwords (Hailman et al. 1985). Therefore, such\na variably structured signal as the chick-a-dee\ncall encourages one to look for properties of\nthe call that convey different messages. Spec-\nulations have been advanced (Hailman et al.\n1987) that each of the four kinds of syllables\nmay signal different tendencies for movement.\nOur study reported here was a first step simply\nto determine if the chick-a-dee call was broad-\ncast with differing rates or the syllable com-\nposition altered in response to predator stim-\nulation that differed only in the urgency of the\nthreat, as indicated by a potential predator pre-\nsented at two different distances from sub-\njects.\nMETHODS\nWe obtained Black-capped Chickadees by trapping\nin natural populations occupying the riparian habitat\nzone of the Cache La Poudre River (40? 36' N, 1050\n05' W) near Fort Collins, Colorado, between 4 No-\nvember 2001 and 7 February 2002. During this period,\nwe brought a few birds at a time into the laboratory,\nheld them for approximately one week during testing,\nand then released them at the site of capture. At the\ntime of capture, we aged the birds by the distribution\nof the white band on the outer rectrices (Pyle et al.\n1987), which we have found to correlate well with the\ndegree of skull ossification in early and late fall ju-\nveniles. We banded the subjects for individual recog-\nnition, held them in individual cages (46 cm long, 22\ncm wide, 26 cm high) in a common room on natural\nphotoperiod, and fed them sunflower seeds and turkey\nstarter daily.\nWe conducted stimulus presentations in a large\nroom with the subject in its cage positioned in a sound\nattenuated box 90 cm above the floor. One side of the\nbox was open and facing a table on which a cardboard\nbarrier prevented the subject from seeing the stimulus\nlocated immediately behind the barrier. With a subject\non its perch in the cage, the base of the stimulus object\nwas 7 cm above the subject when in view. For the near\npresentation, we presented the stimulus at a distance\nof I m from a subject's cage, and for the far presen-\ntation, the table was moved across the room so the\nstimulus was 6 m from a subject's cage. A microphone\nThis content downloaded from\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n129.2.89.26 on Tue, 13 Jan 2026 21:24:52 UTC��������������\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms512 THE WILSON BULLETIN * Vol. 114, No. 4, December 2002\nwas located near the subject's cage and recorded all\nvocalizations.\nA trial consisted of transporting (<30 s) the subject\nin its home cage from the holding room to the test\nchamber, one of us taking a position out of sight of\nthe subject to later present the stimulus, and the other\nof us operating the recorder and timing the trial. A trial\nlasted 5 min. We waited to begin a trial until the sub-\nject started to move about in its cage, hopping between\nperches or eating a sunflower seed, which usually took\nfrom 0-4 min. Upon this movement, the tape recorder\nwas activated and one of us pulled a string that slowly\nmoved the stimulus from behind the cardboard barrier\ninto full view of the subject. Beginning when the sub-\nject gave its first vocalization we recorded calls for 5\nmin. Our data thus consisted of 5 min of vocalizations\nof a subject recorded on one day at one distance to the\nstimulus and 5 min of vocalizations recorded on the\nnext day at the other distance. We tested half the birds\n(n = 12) first at the I m distance and half (n = 12)\nfirst at the 6 m distance.\nThe predator stimulus was a taxidermic mount of a\nPrairie Falcon (Falco mexicanus) in a natural upright\nposture as if perched on a branch. Its head was turned\ntoward the cage of the subject so that its face was fully\nobservable. This is a common predator of small birds\n(Skinner 1938, Bailey and Niedrach 1965) and is seen\nfrequently in the habitats of chickadees in our study\narea, perched on the buildings and in trees on the cam-\npus of the university, and on other commercial build-\nings in Fort Collins.\nWe collected an additional data set on eight other\nchickadees acting as controls for the presentation of\nthe stimulus. We tested these birds at the 1 m distance\nwith the Prairie Falcon and a block of wood of the\nsame size as the predator mount. Four subjects first\nwere presented with the wood block on one day and\nthe predator on the next day, with the reverse order for\nthe other four subjects. This control examined the re-\nsponse of the subjects to a surprising object emerging\nfrom behind the cardboard barrier.\nFrom the stimulus sessions, we timed the latency to\nthe first vocalization of each subject, counted the num-\nber of calls, and tabulated the constituent syllable types\n(ABCD) and their numbers in each chick-a-dee call.\nWith this matched pairs design in which each subject\nserved as its own control, we examined differences\nbetween the two treatments with paired t-tests (Sokal\nand Rohlf 198 1 ) and an alpha level <0.05 for rejection\nof the null hypothesis. For comparison of age groups\nof subjects, we used an unpaired t-test and an alpha\nlevel <0.05.\nWhereas D syllables are discretely different from\nother syllable types in the chick-a-dee call, and can be\nassigned accurately to category, the introductory ABC\nsyllables sometimes exhibit intermediates (Hailman et\nal. 1985, Nowicki and Nelson 1990). When there were\nintermediates between A and B syllables we applied\nan arbitrary rule. Intermediates between these two syl-\nlable categories were defined as A syllables if the ini-\ntial upward frequency sweep (Fig. I) was less than half\nthe length of the downward frequency sweep, or as B\nsyllables if greater than half the range of the subse-\nquent downward frequency sweep. Intermediates be-\ntween B and C syllables were discriminated by the\nusually more harsh broadband characteristics of the C\nsyllable (Fig. 1). C syllables that were less noisy had\na lower peak frequency than B syllables. There were\nfewer intermediates between B and C syllables than\nbetween A and B. Intermediates were less than 5% of\nthe syllables scored. Our observations of the structure\nof the syllables of the chick-a-dee call followed the\ncomments and classifications used in previous studies\n(Apel 1985, Hailman et al. 1985, Nowicki and Nelson\n1990).\nRESULTS\nOf the 24 subjects presented with the Prai-\nrie Falcon mount at two distances, 15 were\n>1 year old (\"old birds\") and 9 were fledged\nduring the breeding season prior to testing\n(\"young birds\"). Comparing the two age\ngroups at the same distance from the predator\nshowed that they did not differ significantly\neither on the latency to the first call or the\nnumber of calls given; therefore they were\ncombined for a test of the two distance treat-\nments (Table 1). The subjects responded more\nquickly to the Prairie Falcon mount when pre-\nsented at 1-m distance than at 6-m distance,\nand they also gave more chick-a-dee calls to\nthe stimulus presented at 1 m than at 6 m (Ta-\nble 1). The control tests of the wood block\nversus the predator indicated a nearly com-\nplete absence of response to the wood block\n(1.4 calls ? 1.0 SE) and a high level of chick-\na-dee calling to the Prairie Falcon mount\n(26.3 calls ? 6.4 SE; t = 4.0, df = 7, P =\n0.005.\nDifferences in syllable composition of\nchick-a-dee calls given in the I-m compared\nto 6-m treatments primarily were in the rela-\ntive proportions of A and B syllables.

From the lack of response\nto the wood block, it is also evident that the\nsubjects viewed the Prairie Falcon mount as a\nsignificant threat, not simply as a surprising\nobject suddenly entering the visual field. Our\nresults are in accord with observations of Apel\n(1985), who noted that the presentation of a\nmount of a Sharp-shinned Hawk (Accipiter\nstriatus) elicited the highest rate of calling\ncompared to that elicited by mounts of other\npotential predators. Sharp-shinned Hawks are\nwell known as important predators of small\npasserine birds. Thus, the high rate of calling\nto a known significant predator found in\nApel's predator presentations to field popula-\ntions of chickadees, together with our labo-\nratory findings of the highest calling to the\nnear distance presentation of the Prairie Fal-\ncon, suggest that the degree of threat is con-\nveyed by high calling rates.\nThere is some evidence in the literature that\nchickadees acquire information about the\nidentity of potential predators through a learn-\ning process (reviewed in Smith 1991). In the\npresent case, this might lead to the expectation\nthat young chickadees would not respond to\nthe Prairie Falcon mount but older birds\nwould respond strongly. Our results showing\nthat younger birds indeed did respond to the\npresentations may therefore indicate that by\nthe time of testing they had acquired sufficient\nexperience to recognize the Prairie Falcon as\na threat. Given the prevalence of this raptor in\nthe study area, this result may not be surpris-\ning.\nIt has been hypothesized that the different\nsyllables of the chick-a-dee call, in the Black-\ncapped Chickadee as well as in the Carolina\nChickadee (Poecile carolinensis) and Mexi-\ncan Chickadee (P. sclateri), may encode dif-\nferent information (Smith 1972; Hailman et al.\n1985, 1987; Ficken et al. 1994; Hailman and\nFicken 1996). Substantial data to examine this\nidea were gathered previously by Apel (1985)\nin an experimental study of Black-capped\nChickadee responses to different kinds of\npredators, both live and taxidermic mounts, in\nseveral contexts. In field presentations during\nboth summer and winter, different types of\npredators sometimes elicited different combi-\nnations of A, B, C, and D syllables (Apel\n1985).

These pie diagrams illustrate proportional\nchanges in syllable composition of chick-a-dee calls\ngiven under the two treatment conditions of presenta-\ntion of a Prairie Falcon mount at a near (I m) and far\n(6 m) distance. The data indicate that the chickadees\nincreased the proportion of A syllables and decreased\nB and C syllables when the predator mount was pre-\nsented at 6 m compared to I m distance. These dia-\ngrams summarize the pooled data for all birds, al-\nthough statistical results (see text) were derived from\npaired comparisons of each subject's calls under the\ntwo treatments.\nble alterations of the chick-a-dee call were\npredator-type dependent and constituted a\nfinely tuned predator recognition response. In\nparticular, Apel hypothesized that an increase\nin the number of A syllables indicated a high-\ner fear level in subjects, whereas a prepon-\nderance of D syllables indicated a less fearful\nstate in the chickadees. In general, the D syl-\nlable content of calls was greater in the mob-\nbing context than in nonmobbing situations.\nAlthough we are unable to make conclu-\nsions about fear levels in our subjects, the\nmost intense response, as measured by calling\nrate, was at the 1-m distance to the predator,\nand this treatment elicited fewer A syllables\nand more B syllables than the 6-m treatment.\nThus, in contrast to Apel's hypothesis, we\nconclude that a more immediate predation\nthreat causes a chickadee to shift its call to\ncontain fewer A syllables and more B sylla-\nbles. Apel also noted that on occasions of nat-\nural chickadee encounters with raptor preda-\ntors, strings of A syllables tend to be heard in\nbirds that have retreated to cover and become\nimmobile, perhaps stimulating alertness in\nothers. This observation may suggest an ap-\npropriate interpretation for our results of in-\ncreased A syllables in the 6-m treatment.\nSeeking cover and becoming immobile could\nbe a good strategy when a predator is first\nseen at a somewhat distant location. However,\nwe did not monitor activity levels in our sub-\njects under the two treatments of predator dis-\ntance and therefore have no data with which\nto address this idea. Although Apel tested sub-\njects with mounts of different kinds of avian\nand mammalian predators as well as examples\nof nonpredators of chickadees, an urgency ef-\nfect was not examined by direct experimen-\ntation, e.g., by varying the distance to a given\npredator, as a possible factor in the chicka-\ndee's responses. This large study (Apel 1985),\nhowever, set the stage for a more systematic\ndisentanglement of the possible effects of\npredator type and response urgency on the\nchickadee mobbing call.\nIn the Mexican Chickadee, the equivalent\nchick-a-dee call exhibited differences in syl-\nlable composition in undisturbed versus dis-\nturbed situations in natural populations (Fick-\nen et al. 1994). Two of the syllable types (A,\nD) predominated in calls on territory with the\nmate present (undisturbed), but in a mobbing\ncontext the AD combination was greatly re-\nduced while C syllables increased (Ficken et\nal. 1994). Although these results are not easily\ncompared to ours, they suggest that, as in our\nfindings, A syllables are reduced in number\nunder conditions of increased predator threat.\nResults of other research on species closely\nrelated to Black-capped Chickadees also are\ninstructive. Studies of the antipredator behav-\nior of the Great Tit (Parus major) have ad-\ndressed the question of vocal signaling in re-\nsponse to predators (Curio et al. 1983, Curio\nThis content downloaded from\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n129.2.89.26 on Tue, 13 Jan 2026 21:24:52 UTC��������������\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/termsBaker and Becker * CHICKADEE MOBBING CALLS 515\nand Regelmann 1985). With restrained live\npredators at fixed locations as stimuli, Great\nTits increased their rate of calling as they ap-\nproached a predator and decreased the rate as\nthey retreated from the predator. This finding\nis similar to ours in that calling rate was high-\ner in chickadees for the near presentation of\nthe Prairie Falcon. In other work, a simulated\nEurasian Sparrrowhawk (Accipter nisus) was\npresented to captive Willow Tits (Parus mon-\ntanus) at two different apparent distances (10\nand 40 m) by use of tiny models (7.2 cm\nwingspan and 1.8 cm wingspan, respectively)\npassed over a subject's cage at a height of 2\nm (Alatalo and Helle 1990). Only 16% of the\nbirds gave alarm calls to the larger (near)\nmodel but 59% gave alarm calls to the smaller\n(far) model. This simulation of predator dis-\ntance showed that the propensity to call was\nlow for a more immediate threat, suggesting\nthat calling might increase the risk of preda-\ntion. No data were provided on the rate of\ncalling or on call structure, so comparisons\nwith our results are limited. However, our sub-\njects all gave mobbing calls at the near dis-\ntance and did so at a high rate, opposite the\ngeneral pattern seen in the Willow Tit exper-\niment. A difference of potential significance is\nthat the simulated predator was a moving one\nin the Willow Tit experiment, whereas the\nPrairie Falcon, once moved into position, was\nmotionless. This difference could affect the\nperceived threat of predation.\nAlarm call variation in several fossorial\nmammals appears primarily to be indicative of\ndiffering levels of response urgency. Structur-\nally different alarm calls are given by Cali-\nfornia ground squirrels (Spermophilus beech-\neyi) to approaching aerial and terrestrial pred-\nators (Owings and Virginia 1978), but these\ncalls grade into one another and can be given\nin other contexts (Owings and Leger 1980).\nThese findings led to the interpretation that\nthese variant call structures signal differing\ndegrees of response urgency (Owings and\nHennessy 1984). Similar general conclusions\nhave been made for other species of ground\nsquirrels (e.g., Robinson 1981) and marmots\n(Blumstein and Armitage 1997).\nOur results on chickadees parallel these\nfindings in that we view urgency as a descrip-\ntor of motivational state, and the differences\nin calling rate and alteration of syllable com-\nposition as reflecting different levels of mo-\ntivation resulting from differences in the im-\nmediacy of predator threat. Therefore, results\nfrom studies that find structural differences in\nalarm calls given to two different classes of\npredator, such as raptor versus mammal,\nsometimes could be misinterpreted as repre-\nsenting more complex cognition than is war-\nranted, unless the immediacy of the threat is\nexamined experimentally as a possible cause\nof the observed differences in alarm calls.\nThe systematic teasing apart of predator la-\nbeling and response urgency as causes of dif-\nferences in vocal signals seldom has been ac-\ncomplished, in spite of the simple experimen-\ntal design required: at least two predator clas-\nses each presented at two levels of response\nurgency. Lemurs, for example, make their call\nselection appropriate to the predator class with\nonly minor vocal alteration signaling urgency\nin avian predation simulations (Macedonia\n1990, Pereira and Macedonia 1991). Other\nstudies also have found predator class labeling\nindependent of urgency (Seyfarth et al. 1980,\nFichtel and Kappeler 2002). In social mon-\ngooses (Suricata suricatta), apparently both\npredator type and urgency information are\ncontained in their antipredator calls (Manser\n2001).\nOur results on chickadee mobbing calls\nsuggest that calling rate and some structural\nalterations vary with the immediacy of pred-\nator threat. Whether these variations in call\nproperties represent signals that effect differ-\nent behavior patterns in conspecifics in the\narea of the calling bird is unknown. Our re-\nsults call attention to the need for studies of\nthe responses of receivers to determine if, for\nexample, the intensity of mobbing behavior or\ndefensive escape and hiding are elicited by the\ncall variations.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe thank A.

The calls consist of four notes, A, B, C,\nand D, which follow simple rules of syntax (note ordering\nand composition) to generate many unique call types. We\nused field playbacks with Carolina chickadees, P. carolinensis, to ask whether violations of a syntactical rule\naffected their vocal responses. We show that chickadee\nresponses to typical calls (e.g. AAAACCCC and CCCCDDDD) differ from responses to atypical calls (e.g.\nCACACACA and DCDCDCDC) depending on playback\nnote composition, season, and social context (presence of\nheterospecifics). In the fall/winter, playbacks of typical\ncalls with A and C notes elicited the greatest number of A\nand B notes in chick-a-dee call responses and typical calls\nwith D notes elicited the greatest number of C notes,\nwhen in the presence of heterospecifics. In contrast, the\ncorresponding atypical calls did not elicit similar responses. This suggests communicative significance is lost\nin calls that violate a rule of syntax in the fall/winter. In\nthe spring, neither chickadee feebeefeebay song rate nor\nchick-a-dee calls responses differed by playback type. We\nsuggest that call syntax is less salient for mated pairs in\nthe spring than it is for fall/winter flocks that rely more on\nconspecific communication for foraging success and flock\ncohesion. This study represents the first experimental\nevidence that chickadees attend to both note composition\nand ordering in chick-a-dee calls.\nKeywords Carolina chickadee · Chick-a-dee call ·\nPoecile · Syntax · Vocal communication\nIntroduction\nAnimals use vocal signals to accomplish a variety of\nsocial tasks and in some taxa selection may favor vocal\nrepertoires of greater complexity (Kroodsma 1977; Blumstein and Armitage 1997; Bradbury and Vehrencamp\n1998; Owings and Morton 1998; Ord et al. 2002). Certain\nspecies attain this complexity by varying the composition\nand possible order of different elements in structurally\ncomplex signals (Hailman and Ficken 1986). Additionally, the structure of the signals may follow simple rules\nof note composition and note ordering (e.g., Hailman\net al. 1985, 1987) and it is suggested that this ‘syntax’<001><fn><001> Note that throughout this paper, we\nare using ‘syntax’ to refer to note ordering and composition (Markovian syntax), and not in the language sense\nof different words being arranged in phrases or sentences\nsuch that changes in word ordering can alter phrase or\nsentence meaning.</fn>might be important in communication (Robinson 1984; Hailman and Ficken 1986;\nBalaban 1988; Kanwal et al. 1994).\nTo demonstrate the importance of syntax in a vocal\nsignaling system, it is not enough to show that signalers\nvary the syntax of their vocalizations; one must also show\nthat receivers respond to variation in syntax. Many avian\nstudies have shown that behavioral responses to local or\ntypical birdsong syntax are different compared to foreign\nor atypical syntax (e.g., Baker et al. 1987; Okanoya et al.\n2000; Holland et al. 2000). Similarly, several primate\nspecies that produce vocal signals governed by a rudimentary syntax give different behavioral responses to\natypical compared to typical vocalizations (Mitani and\nMarler 1989; Ghazanfar et al. 2001; Zuberbuhler 2002).\nThese studies suggest that animals attend to violations of\nCommunicated by W.A.

The chicka-dee call of Poecile species has been intensively analyzed in terms of the production rules governing the\ncomposition and ordering of its notes (Hailman et al.\n1985, 1987; Hailman and Ficken 1986; Ficken et al.\n1994). It is typically made up of four note types that are\ndistinguished by unique acoustic properties, and traditionally designated as A, B, C, and D (Hailman and\nFicken 1986; Ficken et al. 1994; Freeberg et al. 2003;\nBloomfield et al. 2003). The notes follow a general A-BC-D ordering (Hailman et al. 1985; see Fig. 1) and any\nnote can be omitted or repeated up to 30 or more times in\nthe call (Smith 1972). Therefore, the chick-a-dee call\nsystem has the potential to generate an enormous number\nof unique call types. The structural complexity of the\nchick-a-dee call is comparable to that of some birdsong.\nYet unlike most song in songbird species, the chick-a-dee\ncall is produced year round, during different social interactions and many environmental situations. Thus, in\ncontrast to birdsong, chick-a-dee call syntax may accomplish more than communicating species identity or\nsignaler status (e.g. mate choice and territorial functions).\nSeveral studies show that note composition (type and\nnumber of notes) in chick-a-dee calls correlates with the\ncontext of the vocalization (Gaddis 1985; Ficken et al.\n1994) and can affect the behavior of signal recipients\n(Freeberg and Lucas 2002). However, no study has tested\nwhether the order of the note types affect receiver perceptions and subsequent responses in a Poecile species.\nWe conducted field playbacks in the spring and fall/\nwinter of chick-a-dee call variants containing notes in\neither typical (e.g. AAAACCCC and CCCCDDDD) or\natypical (e.g. CACACACA and DCDCDCDC) order to\ntest the possible effect of this syntax violation on the\nvocal responses by Carolina chickadees. The playback\nvariants focused on C notes because previous work found\nthat chickadees responded differently to the presence of a\nstring of C notes in call playbacks compared to calls\nwithout these note types (Freeberg and Lucas 2002). We\nmeasured latency to arrive at playback site, vocalization\nrates, and note composition of chick-a-dee calls produced\nto test for differences in chickadees’ responses to typical\nrelative to atypical syntax call playbacks. Furthermore,\nwe examined the effect of season because chickadees are\nin mated pairs in the spring and in small flocks (often\nheterospecific) in the fall/winter (Brewer 1961; Smith\n1991) and these differences may influence vocal responses to playbacks. Differences in responses would\nsuggest note order is important for communication.\nMethods\nGeneration of playback sets\nWe recorded individual Carolina chickadees in an anechoic room\nunder identical conditions to generate a library of chick-a-dee calls.\nDuring recording, chickadees were housed individually in separate\n1-m3 cages, where birds could hear and often see one another in\nadjoining cages or rooms. The chick-a-dee calls were recorded with\nSaul Mineroff directional electret microphones, placed within 1 m\nof an individual, on Maxell XLII cassette tape using Marantz PMD\n222 portable cassette recorders. Calls were then digitized from\ncassette tape using Cool Edit Pro with 16-bit resolution and a\n22 kHz sampling rate.\nCarolina chickadees typically produce calls with the following\nnote combinations: AC, AD, CD, ACD, or ABD using a range of\nnote numbers (Smith 1972; Freeberg, unpublished data). Chick-adee calls in this Indiana population contain an average of 2.1 A\nnotes (median 2, SD 1.9, range 0–18), 0.1 B notes (median 0, SD\n0.4, range 0–5), 0.5 C notes (median 0, SD 1.1, range 0–9), and 3.4\nD notes (median 3, SD 3.3, range 0–25), based on 1,653 calls\nrecorded from birds at 13 independent field sites (Freeberg, unpublished data). We created eight-note calls that each had four\nnotes of two types (A and C, C and D, or A and D), which controlled for note numbers across playback variants. For calls containing C notes, we made call types with typical note ordering\n(AAAACCCC and CCCCDDDD) and call types with atypical note\nordering (CACACACA and DCDCDCDC). For calls not containing C notes, we made only typical note ordering (AAAADDDD).\nFor each of the eight playback sites, a unique set of these five\nplayback types was generated from previously recorded calls\n(sonagrams of two of the eight sets are given in Fig. 2).\nTo demonstrate that the typical chick-a-dee calls we created do\noccur naturally, we analyzed the syntax of 1,653 field-recorded\ncalls that were collected as part of a different study (Freeberg,\nunpublished data). Calls with the “AD” syntax that contained at\nleast three A notes and at least three D notes occurred 149 times\n(calls from 12 of 13 sites). Calls with the “AC” syntax that contained at least three A notes and at least three C notes occurred 3\ntimes (calls from 3 of 13 sites). Calls with the “CD” syntax that\ncontained at least three C notes and at least three D notes occurred\n22 times (calls from 11 of 13 sites). Calls containing an “ACA” or\n“CAC” note ordering (characteristic of the CACACACA note\ncomposition in our study), or containing an “CDC” or “DCD” note\nordering (characteristic of the DCDCDCDC note composition in\nFig. 1 Sonagrams of two exemplars of chick-a-dee calls of Carolina chickadees (Poecile carolinensis). Sonagrams were generated\nin Cool Edit Pro 2.0 on Windows XP platform, using the Blackmann-Harris windowing function at 256 band resolution. Note type\nclassifications (based on note type designation from Hailman et al.\n1985 and Freeberg and Lucas 2002) are indicated above each\nsonagram\n188our study), at any point in the call’s note composition, did not occur\nin that set of 1,653 calls. Thus, calls with the typical note ordering\nthat we used in our playback study do occur in this population, and\nour field sampling to date has not obtained a call with the sort of\natypical note ordering that we created.\nThere is a fairly smooth transition in the spectral properties of\nnotes given multiple times in a call (Freeberg et al. 2003). This\ntransition is disrupted by definition when calls are made (artificially) with atypical syntax. To ensure that the effect of note order\non chickadees’ responses to our playbacks was not confounded by\nthis, we constructed all calls (i.e., both typical and atypical calls) by\ncombining a single note taken from eight different calls to make a\nsingle playback call consisting of eight notes. Thus, a complete set\nof playback calls for one playback site would be A 1A 2A 3A 4C 5\nC6 C7 C8 , C 7A 4C 5A 1C 8A 2C6 A 3*, A1 A 2A 3A 4D 9D 10 D11 D 12 , C 5C 6C 7\nC8 D9 D 10D 11 D 12, and D 9C 6D 11 C5 D12 C8 D10 C 7* (notes derived from\nthe same bird are indicated with the same subscript and an asterisk\nindicates that the call has atypical note ordering, with the note\nordering for each of these playback types determined randomly).\nCool Edit Pro was used to construct each playback type for each\nplayback set by cutting single notes from the recorded calls. Internote intervals were set at approximately 0.03 s for all notes, the\nmean inter-note intervals measured from chickadee calls in this\npopulation (Freeberg and Lucas, unpublished data). To control for\ngeographic variation in note structure (Freeberg et al. 2003), all\nplayback calls were constructed from notes recorded from birds\ncaptured from the same population as those given playbacks.\nConstructed playback types were then recorded onto Maxell UR\ncassette tapes with a Marantz PMD 222 portable cassette recorder.\nEach playback type was dubbed onto a different tape at roughly one\nvocalization every 10 s for 3 min (the duration of the playback\nperiod in each 10-min block of trials).\nPlayback presentations\nPlaybacks were conducted at the Ross Biological Reserve in West\nLafayette, Indiana, during spring 2001 (March-May) and fall/winter\n2001–2002 (September-January). There were eight playback sites,\neach at least 250 m apart to ensure independence of sites (see\nFreeberg and Lucas 2002). Not all birds responding to the playbacks were banded; however in this study banded birds consistently\nresponded at only one site, within a season. It is possible that an\nunbanded bird responded at more than one site; however, assuming\nflock and pair membership were stable (see Brewer 1961; Dixon\n1963), this is unlikely.\nAt each of the eight sites, we conducted five different playback\npresentations, each on separate days with at least 7 days between\nconsecutive playbacks. One playback type was broadcast during a\npresentation and the order of playback type was randomized across\nsites. Therefore, 40 playback presentations were completed in each\nseason. Playbacks started between 0700 and 1030 hours EST with a\n10-min ‘pre-playback’ observation period to obtain data on background call rate unaffected by playback calls. A novel seed stand (2\nm high) was placed near a playback speaker (hung about 2 m high\nfrom a tree) on arrival to the site and was filled with sunflower\nseeds at the end of the ‘pre-playback’ period.\nThe experimental design was similar to that used by Freeberg\nand Lucas (2002). Briefly, we played back calls with a Marantz\nPMD 222 portable cassette recorder through a Saul Mineroff\npowered speaker. Trials lasted 60 min, which was divided into six\n10-min sections. Each 10-min section began with a 3-min playback\nof a certain call type and ended with 7 min of silence. Trials (including the pre-playback period) were recorded with a second\nportable cassette recorder for subsequent analysis.\nData collection and analyses\nWe collected data on the following:\n1. Number of chickadees vocalizing during the pre-playback period and number responding to each playback.\n2. Rates of major vocalizations during the pre-playback period.\nThese data would allow us to determine whether there were\nseasonal differences in production rates (number calls/h/bird) of\nchick-a-dee calls, gargle vocalizations (an agonistic vocal signal\nof Poecile species), and feebeefeebay songs (the territorial song\nof the species, given only by males).\nFig. 2 Sonagrams of the five\nplayback types from two of the\neight playback sets. Scale of the\naxes and sonagram generation\nparameters are the same as in\nFig. 1. The left panel of sonagrams is the playback set for\nPlayback Site 8, and the right\npanel of sonagrams is the\nplayback set for Playback Site\n5. Note that within each playback set, individual A notes are\nidentical (though ordering may\ndiffer) for the top three rows,\nindividual C notes are identical\n(though ordering may differ) for\nthe bottom four rows, and individual D notes are identical\n(though ordering may differ) for\nthe top row and the bottom two\nrows\n1893. Arrival time (min) for Carolina chickadee receivers to approach\nto within 20 m of the playback speaker and seed stand.\n4. Rates of chick-a-dees, gargles, and feebeefeebays during the\nplayback trial.\n5. Note composition of chick-a-dee call responses of Carolina\nchickadee receivers. Analysis of note composition was restricted to those calls given starting 10 min before the first bird\nbroke the 20-m barrier around the feeder and ending 10 min\nafter the bird(s) first broke the 20-m barrier. We used this 20min subset of calls to ensure that our data reflect a response to\nthe playback.\nRecordings of each playback trial allowed us to analyze receivers’ calls (Cool Edit Pro sound analysis program) to obtain the\nexact composition of all chick-a-dee call responses given within the\n20-min criterion time. Identifying individual receivers was not\npossible from these recordings. However, limiting calls analyzed to\na 20-min period (see previous paragraph) ensured calls analyzed\nwere responses from birds that approached close to the playback\nspeaker and were not multiple pairs/flocks approaching and departing from the playback site. We determined the average number\nof A, B, C, and D notes in calls produced by receivers at the\nplayback sites. The introductory A and B notes were sometimes\ndifficult to distinguish from each other, and inter-individual reliability for these notes was low (50%); therefore we combined these\nnote types in our analysis. A total of 1,502 chick-a-dee calls constituted the complete data set for analysis of note composition in\nbirds responding to our playbacks. B.A.C. scored the 1,502 calls\nthat went into the statistical analyses and T.M.F. independently\nscored 490 calls for inter-observer agreement measures. Independent scoring was within €1 note agreement for 428 of those calls\n(87%).\nWe analyzed the data on arrival times, vocal rates, and numbers\nof A+B, C, and D notes in calls of receivers using repeated measures ANCOVAs with a first-order autoregressive covariance\nstructure (Proc MIXED; SAS Institute 1994). The distributions\nof the data were highly skewed; therefore we log-transformed\n[ln(n+1)] the data for all of the data sets except the pre-playback\nvocal rates, where we log-log-transformed {ln[ln(n+1)+1]} the\ndata, to normalize residuals in the ANCOVA models. For the preplayback data, we tested for effects of season (fall/winter vs spring)\nand playback type. For the playback trial data, we tested for main\neffects of season, playback type, and social context (presence or\nabsence of tufted titmice, Baeolophus bicolor, or white-breasted\nnuthatches, Sitta carolinensis). We also tested for the effect of\nnumber of chickadees responding to our playbacks because vocalization rates will obviously vary with this number. Less obviously, the note composition of chick-a-dee calls given by responders might also vary if the syntax reflects, in part, communication\nbetween birds. To account for these effects, we included the\nnumber of chickadees we detected as covariates in the ANCOVA\nmodels. Playback site was used as the subject variable. All two-way\ninteractions between the main effects and the three-way interaction\nwere added to the models. Non-significant interaction terms were\ndropped from the model in order of decreasing P-value until all\nremaining interactions were significant (P<0.05). Note that the\ndegrees of freedom may vary depending on the interaction terms\nleft in the model. Where significant effects were detected, we tested\nfor significant differences between playback types, season, or social\ncontext using the DIFF option of the LSMEANS calculation in Proc\nMIXED. Below we only report differences that were significant at\na=0.05.\nWe divided the calls into their component parts (A+B, C and D\nnotes) to evaluate the effect of season, playback type and social\ncontext on call syntax. Doing so may inflate the probability of a\ntype I error by underestimating the true P-value (since each call is\nanalyzed three times). Therefore, we use a Bonferroni correction of\nthe a level to account for these multiple tests (a=0.05/3).\nFinally, we used repeated measures Poisson regression\n(GLIMMIX SAS macro in Littell et al. 1996) to evaluate whether\nthe number of responding birds changed between seasons, or\nchanged as a function of playback type.\nResults\nNumber of chickadees vocalizing/number responding\nto playbacks\nThe number of chickadees responding to our playbacks\nranged from 1–4 birds and did not vary with playback type (F=0.904,41, P=0.4735) season (F=0.181,41,\nP=0.6710), and social context (F=0.161,41, P=0.6914).\nRates of chick-a-dees, gargles, and feebeefeebays\nduring the pre-playback period\nCombining pre-playback intervals across all sites, there\nwas a significant effect of season on rates of chick-a-dee\ncall production (F1,14=5.1, P=0.041). More chick-a-dee\ncalls were produced in the fall/winter than in the spring\n(Fig. 3), and chick-a-dee rate increased with the number\nof chickadees observed (F1,15=6.31, P=0.0001). We did\nnot detect an effect of season on rates of gargle production (F1,14=0.00, P=0.96; see Fig. 4). Gargle rates did\nincrease significantly with an increase in the number\nof chickadees (F1,15=10.3, P=0.006). Finally, for feebeefeebay rates there was a significant interaction between the number of chickadees and season (F1,14=11.3,\nP=0.005), with a stronger effect of number of birds on\nsong rate in spring than in fall/winter.\nArrival time to approach within 20 m\nCarolina chickadee receivers generally approached the\nspeaker and seed stand within about 20 min of the start\nof the playback (spring: 18.3€2.8 SE min; fall/winter:\n17.7€3.1 SE min). We did not detect an effect of playback\ntype (F4,31=0.65, P=0.63) or season (F1,8 =0.52, P=0.49)\non arrival times of chickadees. However, arrival time was\nshorter with an increase in the number of responding birds\n(F1,9 =12.6, P=0.0062; b=-1.20€0.34, with log (n+1)\ntransform of arrival time).\nRates of chick-a-dees, gargles, and feebeefeebays\nduring the playback trial\nChick-a-dee rates\nThe main effect of playback type on chick-a-dee rates was\nnot significant (F4.73=1.1, P=0.35). We did not detect an\neffect of season (F1,73=0.00, P=0.99; Fig. 3) or social\ncontext (F1.73=0.12, P=0.73) on rates of chick-a-dee calls\nproduced by receivers. However, when we analyze patterns in chick-a-dee rates separately for each season, the\nnumber of chickadees responding contributes to variance\nin chick-a-dee rates (Table 1).\n190Gargle rates\nChickadee receivers produced no more gargle vocalizations to playbacks in the spring than they did in the\nfall/winter (Fig. 4; F1,73=2.67, P=0.11). We also did not\ndetect an effect of playback type or social context on\ngargle rates (Table 1). In both seasons, gargle rates increased significantly from pre-playback to playback intervals (Fig. 4; fall/winter: F1,60=32.3, P<0.0001; spring:\nF1,60=26.1, P<0.0001), indicating that birds were responding to our playbacks.\nFeebeefeebay rates\nThe interaction of season, number of responding birds and\nplayback type had an effect on rates of feebeefeebay\nproduction (F1,61=3.0, P=0.005). Therefore, analysis of\nfeebeefeebay rates is clearer when the data for the two\nseasons are evaluated separately. In the fall/winter, the\nchickadees rarely responded with feebeefeebay song but\nthe few songs given were to AAAADDDD playbacks\n(Fig. 5a; Table 1). Not surprisingly, male chickadees sang\nmore in the spring and the only factor that correlated\n(positively) with song rates was the number of responding\nbirds (Fig. 5b; Table 1). We added pre-playback feebeefeebay rates to the model to test whether our playbacks elicited a change in song rates. The pre- versus\nduring-playback main effect was significant for both\nseasons (Fig. 5; fall/winter: F1,60=9.52, P=0.003; spring:\nF1,60=9.41, P=0.003), with the average pre-playback rate\nsignificantly lower than the during-playback rate. This\ndemonstrates that feebeefeebay rates of receivers were\nstrongly influenced by our playbacks, especially in the\nspring when singing is most prevalent.\nFig. 3 Chick-a-dee rates (least squares means€SE) elicited by each\nplayback type in the fall (A) and spring (B).

SE were back calculated from the log(n+1) transformation. Multiple comparisons\nsuggest that none of the means within each season are significantly\ndifferent (a=0.05). Playback type and social context designations\nare the same as in Fig. 3\n191Note composition of chick-a-dee calls\nof Carolina chickadee receivers\nWe analyzed the effect of playback type and social context (presence or absence of titmice or nuthatches) for\neach note type in the chickadee call separately. In addition, we focus on trends within seasons following the\nrationale that playback type and social context are the\nmost critical effects that we are evaluating with respect to\nthe note composition of chick-a-dees given by responding\nbirds (noting that these relationships can nonetheless vary\nacross seasons).\nA+B notes\nThere were on average 1.85 A+B notes per call across all\ncalls we analyzed for this study (median=1, lower quartile=1, upper quartile=3, range=0 to 17 A+B notes per\ncall). In the fall/winter, the number of introductory notes\ngiven by the responding birds was affected by each of the\nindependent variables through a significant 3-way interaction (Table 2). Interestingly, holding number of birds\nresponding and social context constant, the number of\nintroductory notes was highest in response to the playbacks with typical syntax (especially AC playback),\ncompared to calls with atypical syntax (Fig. 6a). In the\nspring, there were no significant trends (Fig. 6b).\nC notes\nThe calls we analyzed had an average of 0.97 C notes\nin them (median=0, lower quartile=0, upper quartile=1,\nrange=0 to 12 C notes per call). In the fall/winter, the\nnumber of C notes in chick-a-dee calls elicited from our\nplaybacks was highest for playbacks with typical syntax,\nand this effect varied with playback note composition\nand was also affected by the presence of titmice and\nnuthatches. The two main effects, playback type and social context, and their interaction were significantly correlated with the number of C notes in the calls (Fig. 7a;\nTable 2). A multiple comparisons test indicates that the\nAAAADDDD and CCCCDDDD playbacks in the presence of titmice and nuthatches elicit chick-a-dee calls rich\nin C notes. All other typical combinations of note composition and social context in the fall/winter elicited calls\nwith fewer C notes, as did all of the atypical syntax\nplaybacks (Fig. 7a; Table 2). The number of birds responding did not affect the number of C notes in the calls\nFig. 5 Feebeefeebay rates (least squares means€SE) elicited by\neach playback type in the fall (A) and spring (B).

In the fall/winter, we did not\ndetect an effect of playback type on the number of D\nnotes in a call (Fig. 8a), but there was a significant effect\nof social context, through an interaction with the number of responding conspecifics. Chickadees increased the\nnumber of D notes with increasing number of conspecifics responding in the absence of titmice or nuthatches\n(b=0.43€0.14) but decreased the number of D notes with\nan increase in conspecifics responding in the presence of\ntitmice or nuthatches (b=0.11€0.10) (Table 2). Note that\nthe reduction in number of D notes in the presence of\nheterospecifics is caused by a change in note composition compared to chick-a-dee calls given when no heterospecifics were present. This response is not a simple\nreduction in chick-a-dee rates.\nIn the spring, there was a statistically not significant\neffect of playback type on the number of D notes in the\ncall and a significant interaction between playback type\nand number of responding birds (Table 2). As the number\nof birds responding increased in the spring, the number of\nD notes decreased, but the strongest decrease was for\ntypical AC calls (b=-0.50€0.23). In contrast, there was no\neffect of number of birds responding on the number of D\nnotes given in response to typical CD calls (b=0.01€\n0.20). The other three calls had intermediate effects\n(CD atypical: 0.008€0.22; AC atypical: 0.0026€0.31;\nAD typical: 0.251€0.21). Holding number of birds responding constant, the number of D notes per call given in\nresponse to normal AC calls was significantly less than\nthe number of D notes given in response to any other call.\nAll other comparisons were not significant.\nDiscussion\nThis study tested whether Carolina chickadees would attend to violations of a syntactical rule in their chick-a-dee\ncall by responding differently to call playbacks of typical\nnote order versus atypical note order. The results show\nthat although vocalization rates did not vary with playback type, there were subtle differences in the note\ncomposition of chick-a-dee call responses to typically\nordered calls compared to atypically ordered calls. Season\n(spring or fall/winter) and social context (presence or\nabsence of heterospecifics) also contributed to these response differences and may reflect the effect of seasonal\nchanges in chickadee social structure and heterospecific\ninteractions on intraspecific communication. Thus, note\norder affects response behavior and the presence of this\nnote order effect suggests that calls with atypical syntax\ncan lose communicative significance.\nWe conducted playbacks across two seasons, spring\nand fall/winter, because seasonal variation in social systems can affect the use of components of a vocal repertoire. An obvious example is the seasonal use of song in a\nwide variety of songbirds (see Kroodsma and Miller\n1996). Male song provides a mechanism for territory\ndefense and advertisement of its borders, and is often\ndropped entirely from male repertoires outside of the\nbreeding season. Thus it was not surprising that male\nchickadees sang almost exclusively in the spring when\nthey defend a territory with their mate, and very little the\nfall/winter when chickadees form small flocks (Smith\n1972; Smith 1991). In the spring, male chickadees increased song rates during all of our playbacks suggesting\nterritorial males investigate and aggressively respond to\nconspecific calls regardless of note order.\nChick-a-dee call responses were given at similar rates\nbetween season and rates did not differ between playback\ntypes within season. However, in the fall/winter the note\ncomposition of chick-a-dee call responses differed depending on the playback type. Specifically, chickadees\nproduced chick-a-dee calls with the most introductory (A\nand B) notes in response to typical AC playbacks (regardless of the presence of heterospecifics) and calls with\nthe most C notes in response to the other typical playbacks (AD and CD) when in the presence of het-\nFig. 8 Number of D notes (LSM€SE) in chick-a-dee calls as a\nfunction of playback in the fall (A) and spring (B). Playback type\ndesignations are the same as in Figure 3\n194erospecifics. Atypically ordered playbacks with the same\nnumber and composition of notes did not elicit similar\nresponses, suggesting that the chickadees do not perceive\nthem as the same call as the typically ordered playbacks.\nIn contrast to these fall/winter patterns, there was no\ndifference in the note composition of chick-a-dee calls\nelicited by different playbacks broadcast in the spring. We\nsuggest that this seasonal variation in vocal communication reflects seasonal changes in social structure. Unlike\nmated pairs in the spring, Carolina chickadees form small\nflocks of unrelated individuals during the fall that remain\ntogether throughout the winter (Brewer 1961; Dixon\n1963). The chick-a-dee call is thought to play an important communicative role in maintaining flock cohesion\nand facilitating foraging (Smith 1991). Thus, we might\nexpect chickadees to be more sensitive to differences in\nchick-a-dee call syntax from unknown birds (our playbacks) in the fall/winter compared to in the spring.\nHowever, what could explain the fact that different notes\nwere produced dependent on playback type and social\ncontext in the fall/winter? More fundamentally, why\nmight selection favor a call system that can generate\nmany unique call types using rules for note ordering and\ncomposition?\nObviously, the benefit of communicating among conspecifics is not the only factor that may affect the production and perception of vocal signals. The production of\nsignals is risky. By attracting the attention of unintended\nreceivers, animals can expose themselves to social and\npredation costs. For example, subordinates that vocalize in\nthe presence of a rich food source may elicit aggression\nfrom more dominant animals nearby (Wrangham 1977)\nand advertisement signals used during mating can be exploited by predators to localize and prey on signalers\n(Endler 1991; Ryan et al. 1982). One solution for minimizing the risks associated with communication would be\na flexible repertoire where different signals can be given\ndepending on circumstance. Thus, signalers might have\nthe option of using a subset of calls that are ‘cautious’ in\nthe sense that they are not easily heard or localized, and\nanother, more conspicuous, subset for use under less risky\nconditions to produce a richer set of information. A classic\nexample is the Tfflngara frog (Physalaemus pustulosus)\nwhine-chuck call system where males omit the conspicuous “chuck” element when predation risk is increased\n(Ryan 1985).\nDuring the fall/winter, chickadees often form mixed\nspecies flocks with other bird species, in particular with\nwhite-breasted nuthatches and tufted titmice (Brewer\n1961). Although chickadees are known as a ‘nuclear species’ in the mixed species flocks, they are the subordinate\nmembers (Morse 1970; Cimprich and Grubb 1994). It is\nsuggested that heterospecifics may exploit communication between chickadees to find food and this could incur\ncompetition costs for chickadees (Sullivan 1984). Indeed,\nCimprich and Grubb (1994) showed that when tufted\ntitmice were experimentally removed, chickadees experienced increased nutritional condition. Thus, in the\ncontext of titmice or nuthatches in close proximity, the\nincreased numbers of C notes in chick-a-dee calls in response to our typical call playbacks by chickadees may be\nrelated to competition with those more dominant species.\nAlternatively, chickadees may only respond with more\nC notes when in the presence of heterospecifics because\npredation risk is decreased in larger mixed species flocks\n(Gaddis 1980; Pravosudov and Grubb 1999; Dolby and\nGrubb 2000). Krams (2001) found that sparrowhawks\n(Accipiter nisus) attacked models of great tits (Parus\nmajor) more during playbacks of long-range, trilled calls\nthan during short-range, high-pitched calls. Similar to\ntrilled notes, C notes are harsh ‘chick’ like notes that have\na large bandwidth and are thus likely to be relatively easy\nto localize, by predators and heterospecifics alike (Marten\nand Marler 1977; Wiley 1991; Krams 2001). Therefore,\nchick-a-dee calls containing C notes may be riskier than\ncalls with other note compositions. For example, introductory notes (A and B) are high frequency whistles and\nmight be harder to locate. This might explain why\nchickadees increased the number of introductory notes in\nresponse to a typical call playbacks compared to their\nresponse to the atypical call playbacks. Nonetheless,\nstudies of predator responses to chick-a-dee calls varying\nin note composition are needed (Lima 2002), as well as\nexperiments that examine chickadee vocalizations given\nin varying degrees of predation risk.\nOther playback studies have tested for the significance\nof note ordering in vocalizations by measuring differences\nin responses to typical versus atypical note ordering\n(Mitani and Marler 1989; Esser et al. 1997, Okanoya\net al. 2000; Holland et al. 2000; Ghazanfar et al. 2001;\nZuberbuhler 2002). However, it can be argued that\ndemonstrating these different response behaviors to signals with atypical syntax that do not occur naturally is\ntrivial (e.g., Evans and Marler 1995). Therefore, we are\nhesitant to make broad generalizations about the role of\nnote ordering in the chick-a-dee call system at this point.\nStill, we do believe that simply demonstrating an effect of\nnote ordering on receiver responses is an important initial\nstep to take in understanding the perceptual, affective, and\npossibly referential aspects of the chick-a-dee call. We are\nalso aware that the resolution of our results could improve\nby not only accounting for the number of birds responding\nto our playbacks, but by analyzing note composition of\nchick-a-dee responses by individual.\nThe importance of note order in the chick-a-dee calls\nof signalers has been suggested in several previous studies\n(Smith 1972, Hailman et al. 1985, Hailman and Ficken\n1986). However, it was also important to demonstrate that\nbehavioral responses varied dependent on syntactical\nproperties. Additionally, the importance of the context in\nwhich signals are produced and received was demonstrated by the differences in vocal responses seen between\nseasons and by the differences due to social context. This\nstudy provides a preliminary examination of the importance of syntax and further experimental playbacks with\nCarolina chickadees and other Poecile species are needed\nto examine the functional role of syntax in this complex\ncommunication system.\n195Acknowledgements We would like to thank Jack P.

Thus,\nphosphorylation and arrestin binding are unlikely to constitute the standard termination of\nolfactory responses. Possibly, phosphorylation\nis important for desensitization in situations\nof prolonged and intense stimulation.\nA short-lived receptor-odorant complex\ndoes not preclude an overall high olfactory\nsensitivity. Repeated bindings of odorant\nmolecules to the same receptor allow signal\nintegration, especially if receptor phosphorylation does not occur (unlike in vision, where\na photon acts only once and a photobleached\npigment molecule is nonfunctional). The total\nrate of odorant-binding events is also amplified by orders of magnitude by the total number of receptor molecules on an ORN. The\nsupralinear interactions occurring when unitary transduction domains overlap can further\nenhance sensitivity at intermediate odorant\nconcentrations and durations. Finally, a high\nconvergence of sensory input at the glomerulus (23) may boost sensitivity. The glomerulus is the synaptic plexus in the olfactory\nbulb that integrates signals from all ORNs\nexpressing the same odorant receptor species.\nIn principle, this convergence can increase\nindefinitely by simply expanding the surface\narea of the olfactory epithelium and therefore\nthe number of ORNs expressing a given odorant receptor. This increase in convergence may\nexplain why the olfactory sensitivity in many\nanimals is much higher than it is in humans.\nUnlike the retinotopic map in vision, which\nimposes a functional limit on the degree of\nconvergence from photoreceptors, no corresponding limitation exists in olfaction.\nReferences and Notes\n1.

Templeton,1\n*. Erick Greene,1 Kate Davis2\nMany animals produce alarm signals when they detect a potential predator,\nbut we still know little about the information contained in these signals.\nUsing presentations of 15 species of live predators, we show that acoustic\nfeatures of the mobbing calls of black-capped chickadees (Poecile atricapilla)\nvary with the size of the predator. Companion playback experiments revealed\nthat chickadees detect this information and that the intensity of mobbing\nbehavior is related to the size and threat of the potential predator. This study\ndemonstrates an unsuspected level of complexity and sophistication in avian\nalarm calls.\nPredation is a major cause of mortality for\nmost species of animals, and many produce\nalarm signals when they perceive a potential\npredator (1). Alarm calls often differ in\nacoustic structure, depending on the situation\nin which they are produced (2–5). If a\nspecies is preyed upon by different predators\nthat use different hunting strategies or vary\nin the degree of danger they present, selection can favor variation in alarm signals\nFig. 4.

Such variation in alarm signals can be used to transfer information about the type of predator\nEreferential alarm call systems (7)^, the degree\nof threat that a predator represents Erisk-based\nsystems (8)^, or both (9, 10).\nIn addition to discriminating among\nbroad types of predators (e.g., raptor versus\nsnake), discriminating among morphologically similar predators within a single type\n(e.g., different species of raptors) could also\nbe adaptive if the predators vary in the\ndegree of threat they pose. One species that\nis faced with numerous, morphologically\nsimilar predators is the black-capped chickadee (Poecile atricapilla). Chickadees are\nsmall, common songbirds that are widespread throughout North America. In the nonbreeding season, chickadees form flocks of six\nto eight birds (11). They use an elaborate\nsystem of vocalizations to mediate social\ninteractions in these flocks (12, 13) and to\nwarn conspecifics about predators (14, 15).\nChickadees produce two very different\nalarm signals in response to predators: When\nflying raptors are detected, chickadees produce a high-frequency, low-amplitude Bseet[\nalarm call; in response to a perched or stationary predator, they produce a loud, broadband Bchick-a-dee[ alarm call that is composed\nof several types of syllables (16) (Fig. 1A).\nWhereas the Bseet[ alarm call functions to\nwarn of flying predators, the Bchick-a-dee[\nmobbing alarm call recruits other chickadees\nEand often many other species (17)^ that\nharass, or mob, a perched predator. This\nBchick-a-dee[ call is a complex vocalization\nthat is also produced in many other situations\nand encodes information about food and\nidentity (both individual and flock) in addition to information about predators (11).\nWe examined variation in the mobbing\nvocalizations and behavior of black-capped\nchickadees by conducting predator presentations and playback experiments with chickadees living under semi-natural conditions in\nlarge, outdoor experimental aviaries (18).\nWe presented flocks of color-marked chickadees with 13 species of live, perched raptors\nand two species of live mammalian predators. The predators varied considerably in\nbody size (e.g., factor of 20 difference in\nbody mass between northern pygmy-owl and\ngreat horned owl), activity patterns, hunting\nstrategies, and diet (Table 1). The raptors\nranged from small, maneuverable predators\nwhose diets include many small birds, to\nlarge, less maneuverable predators that eat\nfew small birds. We also used two types of\ncontrols: a procedural control with a live\nbobwhite quail (Colinus virginianus); and no\npresentation, with observers present as they\nwould be during predator presentations. During each predator presentation, two observers\nrecorded chickadee vocalizations, noting the\ncolor band combination of each calling individual. By conducting controlled presentations of live predators to birds living under\nsemi-natural conditions, we could isolate\nvocal responses to specific species of predators from other features such as the location, behavior, or movement pattern of the\npredator.\nSpectrographic analyses of the more than\n5000 Bchick-a-dee[ mobbing alarm calls we\nrecorded (Fig. 1) revealed previously unsuspected levels of acoustic variation. The\nnumber of mobbing calls produced in response\nto each predator was highly variable [analysis of variance (ANOVA): F16, 34 0 5.17, P G\n0.0001^, with the smaller, higher risk, predators eliciting significantly more calls than the\nlarger predators or controls (Tukey_s post hoc\ntests: P G 0.05). The total number of syllables\nper alarm call differed among predator treatments (F 0 3.05, P G 0.0001). In particular,\nthe average number of D syllables, or notes,\nper call differed significantly across predator\ntreatments (F 0 7.771, P G 0.0001). There\nwas a strong inverse relationship between the\nnumber of D notes per alarm call and the\nwingspan of the raptors, with the smallest\npredators eliciting calls with the most D notes\n(Fig. 2A; r2 0 0.512, P G 0.0001).

For example, in\ncomparisons of mobbing calls given in response to a northern pygmy-owl and a great\nhorned owl (small and large predators, respectively), the duration of the Bdee[ section\n(all D notes) was significantly longer (ANOVA:\nF1,14 0 9.984, P 0 0.003), the interval between\nthe Bchick[ and Bdee[ sections was significantly shorter (F 0 11.364, P 0 0.001), the\nfirst D note of each call was shorter (F 0\n9.984, P 0 0.003), and the interval between\nthe first and second D notes was also shorter\nin small predator alarm call variants (F 0\n9.043, P 0 0.004). Calls that chickadees\nproduced during the large predator presentations tended to have D notes that contained more high-energy peaks above –10\ndB (F 0 2.855, P 0 0.097) spanning a wider\nbandwidth (F 0 2.719, P 0 0.105) than those\nproduced during encounters with small predators. D notes elicited by large predators also\ntended to have more widely spaced overtones\n(F 0 3.385, P 0 0.071). No differences were\nobserved in any of the other measured features\n(P 9 0.2 for all).\nDo these acoustic differences in mobbing\ncalls transmit information about the potential\npredator to other chickadees? We conducted\nplayback experiments (18) to test how\nchickadees reacted to the mobbing calls that\nthey produced in response to different predators by broadcasting variations of the\nBchick-a-dee[ alarm vocalization associated\nwith different predators. We played mobbing\ncalls that flock mates produced in response\nto a great horned owl (large predator), a northern pygmy-owl (small predator), and control\ncalls of a pine siskin (Carduelis pinus).\nChickadees exhibited longer and more intense\nmobbing behavior when they heard alarm\ncalls recorded in response to a pygmy-owl\nthan when they heard alarm calls recorded in\nresponse to a great horned owl or control vocalizations (Fig. 3). They produced significantly more Bchick-a-dee[ calls in response to\nplayback of mobbing alarm calls elicited by a\nsmall predator than they did when presented\nwith playbacks of mobbing calls elicited by a\nlarge predator or control vocalizations (Fig.\n3A; Kruskal-Wallis K 0 11.50, P 0 0.003).\nChickadees approached the hidden speaker\nmore closely in response to the small predator\nmobbing call treatment than in response to the\nlarge predator mobbing call or control treatments (K 0 14.69, P 0 0.001); more individuals approached within 3 m (Fig. 3B; K 0\n14.40, P 0 0.001) and within 1 m (K 0 11.34,\nP 0 0.003) of the speaker in response to the\nsmall predator alarm calls than in response to\nthe large predator alarm calls or control\nvocalizations. After playback of small predator alarm calls, chickadees also mobbed for\nlonger periods than they did after playback of\nlarge predator alarm calls and control sounds\n(K 0 12.69, P 0 0.002).\nPrevious studies have shown that animals\nproduce different antipredator vocalizations\nfor aerial and terrestrial predators. Most of\nthese studies, however, have presented these\ntwo types of predators in different ways\n(19–21), potentially confounding the interpretation that prey distinguish between types\nof predators and not their location or\nTable 1.

Our results show that chickadees do\nnot vocally discriminate between raptors and\nmammals when they are presented in similar\nways, and thus the Bchick-a-dee[ call does not\nrefer specifically to the type of predator.\nInstead, these vocal signals likely contain information about the degree of threat\nthat a predator represents. Maneuverability\n(e.g., as measured by turning radius, or\nradial acceleration) is extremely important\nin determining the outcome of predator-prey\ninteractions and is inversely related to wingspan and body size in birds (22, 23). Body\nsize may be a good predictor of risk for\nchickadees: Small raptors tend to be much\nmore maneuverable than larger raptors and\nlikely pose a greater threat to chickadees.\nIn addition to being one of the most subtle and sophisticated signaling systems yet\ndiscovered, this system is unusual in that it\ncombines aspects of both referential and\nrisk-based antipredator vocalization systems\n(10, 24, 25). To denote the presence of a rapidly moving predator (e.g., raptor in flight),\nchickadees produce a Bseet[ alarm call. When\nthey encounter a stationary predator (e.g.,\nperched raptor), they use the Bchick-a-dee[\nmobbing call. These two vocalizations appear\nto be functionally referential to the type of\npredator encounter (i.e., each denotes a specific type of encounter). In addition, we have\nshown that subtle variation in the Bchick-adee[ mobbing call reflects the size of a\nspecific predator, a characteristic of a riskbased system. Thus, chickadees convey information about predators at two different levels:\nA coarse level of encoding (Bseet[ or Bchicka-dee[) signifies the type of predator encounter, and a fine level of encoding (variants of\nBchick-a-dee[) signifies the degree of danger\npresented by that specific predator encounter.\nThe Bchick-a-dee[ vocalization is remarkably versatile; it is used in many different\ncontexts and apparently conveys many different types of information. The fact that so\nmuch information can be transmitted by subtle\nvariations in one type of vocalization raises\nsome fascinating questions about how finely\nchickadees can discriminate between similar\nstimuli, and how they categorize different aspects of their environment.\nReferences and Notes\n1.

Few animal\nstudies, however, have examined the information content of call combinations compared\nwith the information conveyed by each call singularly. We examined several aspects of call\ncombinations in the repertoire of wild chimpanzees in the Tai Forest, Ivory Coast, including\nthe types of combinations, the contexts and possible functions and compared these with the\nuse of single calls. Almost half of all vocalisations produced by the Tai chimpanzees occurred\nin combination with other vocalisations or with drumming. A total of 88 different types of\ncombinations were used. Single calls and call combinations were each produced in specific\ncontexts. The contexts in which six of ten combinations were produced differed from the\ncontexts of at least one of the component calls. The contexts in which the combinations were\nproduced varied from the component calls in five different ways, three having potentially\nnovel functions. Two of the three may have an additive function, such that two pieces of\ninformation can be conveyed simultaneously, increasing message complexity. This analysis\nclearly shows that call combinations are an important part of chimpanzee communication.\nThe implications with regard to the evolution of human language are discussed.

Calls need to vary if different information is to be transmitted and de-\ncoded. However, most mammals' calls are innately programmed, such that\nsignallers have limited ability to modify the structure of their calls into new\ncall types (Janik & Slater, 1997). An alternative way of increasing decod-\nable information is to use sounds in combination rather than singularly. The\ncombinatorial power of call combinations can vastly increase the number of\ndifferent words, in the case of humans (Bickerton, 1990), or songs, in the\ncase of birds (Kroodsma, 1982) and whales (Payne & Payne, 1985), which\ncan be produced. In fact, in terms of more message possibilities, combin-\ning sounds is more efficient than producing new sounds (Jackendoff, 1999).\nStrikingly little research has examined the information content of combined\ncalls compared with single calls (Zuberbuihler, 2002).\nCalls used in combination have, nonetheless, provoked interest in animal\nstudies probing for 'fossils' of language (Jackendoff, 1999), in particular\nsyntax. All human languages essentially require two types of syntax. In\nphonological syntax, where strings of sounds are grouped together according\nto certain rules, the individual sounds themselves do not convey meaning.\nIn lexical syntax, where strings of words are grouped together according\nto certain rules, the individual words do convey meaning (Marler, 1977;\nJackendoff, 1999).\nExamples of phonological syntax in animals are not uncommon, espe-\ncially in the learned songs of birds (e.g., Kroodsma & Miller, 1982) and\nwhales (Payne & Payne, 1985). In primates, the call combinations usually\ncited are long distance calls, used for regulatory spacing between groups\n(Marler, 1977). These have been described as stereotyped in structure, so\nthat the combinations occur in a fixed order. Furthermore, the contexts in\nwhich the combinations occur differ from the contexts of the component\ncalls (chimpanzee pant hoot: Marler & Hobbett, 1975; gibbon song: Mi-\ntani & Marler, 1989; gray-cheeked mangeby 'whoop-gobble': Waser, 1975;\nblue monkeys 'ka-train': Marler, 1973). As such they have been labelled as\na primitive form of phonological, rather than lexical syntax (Marler, 1977).\nSince then, there have been tantalising descriptions of call combinations\nby apes that are not just limited to long distance calls, for example, barks\nThis content downloaded from\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n129.2.89.26 on Tue, 13 Jan 2026 21:27:52 UTC��������������\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/termsCall combinations in chimpanzees 399\ncombined with screams or grunts (chimpanzees: Goodall, 1986; bonobos:\nBermejo & Omedes, 1999). However, little quantitative assessment of the\nextent and possible functions of these calls has been conducted. Crockford\n& Boesch (2003) found in chimpanzees, that barks produced in combination\nwith buttress-tree drumming occurred specifically in travel contexts or dur-\ning neighbour encounters. In other primates, there are a few studies that have\nexamined different types of call combinations, their contexts of production\nand possible functions relative to each call produced singularly (Robinson,\n1979, 1984; Cleveland & Snowdon, 1982; Zuberbuhler, 2002). In each case\nthe results indicated that primates are using certain forms of 'lexical syntax'.\nRobinson (1984) unpacked Marler's (1977) term 'lexical syntax' used to\ndescribe call combinations, into two aspects (a) where one call acts as a\ncontextual modifier for the other and (b) where grammatical rules gener-\nate combinations of words to form sentences. Call combinations produced\nin contexts intermediary to their component calls have been described by\nRobinson (1984) as acting as contextual modifiers. However to date, no ex-\namples in animals can be described as having grammatical rules that generate\ncombinations to form sentences.\nExamples of contextual modifiers have been found in primates (Cleveland\n& Snowdon, 1982; Robinson, 1984; Zuberbuhler, 2002), wolves (Schass-\nburger, 1993) and willow ptarmigans (Martin et al., 1995). Usually the con-\ntexts in which call combinations were produced were intermediary to those\nof the component calls. For example, in cotton-top tamarins, type E' chirps\nwere produced in general alarm situations and squeaks in general alert situa-\ntions, other than alarm. The two call types combined were produced in inter-\nmediary contexts requiring vigilance but with reduced fear or alarm (Cleve-\nland & Snowdon, 1982).\nZuberbuhler (2002) used playback experiments to establish that the re-\nsponses of listeners changed if a so called 'leopard' alarm call was preceded\nby a general alert 'boom' call. While diana monkeys produced their own\nleopard alarm calls on hearing a Campbell monkey leopard alarm, they pro-\nduced no alarm calls on hearing either a Campbell monkey 'boom' call alone\nor a 'boom' call followed by a Campbell monkey alarm call. The 'boom' call\nseems to have modified the information conveyed by the alarm call, and as\nsuch is indicative of an early form of lexical syntax.\nIn another form of contextual modification, a call combination may act as\nan intensification of the context of the component calls. Schassburger (1993)\nThis content downloaded from\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n129.2.89.26 on Tue, 13 Jan 2026 21:27:52 UTC��������������\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms400 Crockford & Boesch\ndocumented that although wolves used barks and growls as threats, a bark-\ngrowl combination carried a more intense threat than either bark or growl\nalone.\nClearly, the analysis of single call types relative to call combinations is\nnecessary for ascertaining the functions of call combinations. In summary\nand in addition to the examples given above, suggested functions, to date,\ninclude expression of an intermediary internal state (Robinson, 1984), ex-\npressing ambivalence (Schassburger, 1993), refined expression by emphasis-\ning emotional intensity (Schassburger, 1993), or one call acting as a syntac-\ntic modifier of another (Zuberbiihler, 2002). Alternatively, call combinations\nmay advertise male quality (tingara frogs: Kime et al., 1988). All of these\nputative functions suggest that information conveyed by call combinations\nis additional to information conveyed by the single call types, such that call\ncombinations increase the range of information that can be decoded by oth-\ners.\nIt is unlikely that call combinations used by any animal approach the\ncomplexity of syntax used in human language, particularly in terms of re-\ncursion, which involves the limitless embedding of clauses into sentences\n(Jackendoff, 1999; Bickerton, 2003; Fitch & Hauser, 2004). Nonetheless,\ncomparative research is crucial if we are to resolve what is unique to humans\nas oppose to what constitutes 'fossils' of human language or language abil-\nities (Jackendoff, 1999; Hauser et al., 2002). As stated above it seems that\nchimpanzees use a range of call combinations (Goodall, 1986), one of which\nis produced in specific contexts (Crockford & Boesch, 2003). We further\nexamine the extent of the occurrence of call combinations in the repertoire\nof wild chimpanzees, the types of combinations that occur, the contexts in\nwhich they occur and the possible functions they may have.\nMethods\nStudy site, individuals and data collection\nChimpanzees from two neighbouring habituated groups were observed be-\ntween February 1999 through to May 2000 in the Tai National Park, Cote\nd'Ivoire, West Africa (site description in: Boesch & Boesch-Achermann,\n2000). Data were collected continuously using focal animal sampling (Alt-\nman, 1974) with dawn to dusk follows, and ad-libitum sampling of non-focal\nThis content downloaded from\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n129.2.89.26 on Tue, 13 Jan 2026 21:27:52 UTC��������������\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/termsCall combinations in chimpanzees 401\nchimpanzees. All adults of the North community (3 adult males and 10 adult\nfemales) as well as all three adult males of the Middle community were in-\ncluded in the analysis. C.C. collected 590 hours of data from the six adult\nmales and 520 hours from 10 adult females. Chimpanzees alternated as focal\nanimals and could easily be followed at a distance of 3-5 m.\nAll vocalisations were recorded using a Sennheisser ME65/K6 directional\nmicrophone and windshield and a Sony WMD6C Professional Walkman at\na distance of 3-15 m from the individual.\nTo determine the context of calling for the focal chimpanzee, each change\nof behaviour, each social interaction and each vocalisation of, or directed to,\nthe focal chimpanzee was documented with the time of occurrence. Events\nin the forest that the target animal looked towards for more than 10 seconds\nwere also documented, such as encounters with snakes and chimpanzees\nfrom other communities.\nClassification of single and combined calls\nSingle call types were defined as those easily distinguishable from each other\nby ear. Chimpanzee vocalisations are graded such that each call type has\n'pure', easy to categorise, variants such as screams and barks, and 'inter-\nmediate' variants such as those acoustically between scream and bark and\ntherefore difficult to categorise. We excluded 'intermediate' variants of all\ncall types from the analysis. We distinguished 15 vocalisations and included\none frequently occurring non-vocal signal, buttress tree drumming (Table 1).\nThis classification differs from the two published chimpanzee repertoires at\nother chimpanzee sites, probably as a result of differing tendencies to lump\nor split calls into the same or different call categories (32 different call types\nat Gombe: Goodall, 1986; 11 different call types at Kanyawara: Clark, 1991).\nCross-site detailed acoustic analysis accompanied by contextual correlates of\ncalling, for the entire chimpanzee repertoire, is required to resolve this issue.\nIn addition, we noted combinations of calls and calls with drums (here-\nafter 'call combinations' for simplicity). We distinguished between single\nand combined calls as follows: single calls were defined as those occurring\nas single elements or a series of elements of the same call type. Calls of the\nsame type, joined by audible inhaled elements (or pants) were also counted\nas single calls. On the other hand, calls of one type that were immediately\nfollowed by another call type, and usually joined by an audible inhalation,\nThis content downloaded from\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n129.2.89.26 on Tue, 13 Jan 2026 21:27:52 UTC��������������\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms402 Crockford & Boesch\nTable 1.

For example, the pant hoot sequence, a\nspecies specific call combination found in all chimpanzee populations, can\nbe made up of hoos, screams, barks and drums. The hoos, screams and barks\nusually follow each other without any audible break. In cases where call\ntypes were not joined by audible inhalations, such as grunts followed by\nhoos, different call types occurring in a single bout of calling were classi-\nfied as call combinations. The time gap between calls in a single bout is\nconsiderably shorter than the time gap between call bouts and can be reli-\nably determined by ear. On randomly examining 50 recorded call bouts, we\nfound that the time gap between calls in a call bout was generally less than\none second, and never greater than 1.5 seconds. Single call elements which\nbegan as one call type and graded to a different call type within the same call\nelement, for example a call starting as a scream and ending as a bark, were\nnot included as call combinations and were also excluded from the analysis.\nAnalysis of contextual correlates of calls and call combinations\nWe first tested whether call types occurred in particular contexts more often\nthan expected, using one sample t tests (see Table 2 for context definitions).\nThis content downloaded from\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n129.2.89.26 on Tue, 13 Jan 2026 21:27:52 UTC��������������\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms404 Crockford & Boesch\nTable 2.

Since activity budgets for\nadult chimpanzees in Tai do not differ significantly, we have calculated the\nactivity budget across all chimpanzees, using the same time period during\nwhich the behavioural data was collected (see Table 2 for calculation of ex-\npected values). The data used in the t tests were the percentage of a particular\ncall type used in each context for each chimpanzee. The percentages were\ntested against the expected value of each context Call types were collapsed\ninto broad categories, for example all grunt types were simply grouped as\n'grunts', unless otherwise stated. 'Laugh' was excluded because of its small\nsample size. We analysed call types where a context or interaction could be\nclearly attributed. This included all occurrences of less frequently occurring\ncall types. However, for common call types (those with >400 occurrences)\na representative distribution of single calls was analysed (taken from a ran-\ndomly selected 50% of the total number of full day focal follows). In addition\nto conducting t tests, we noted when more than 80% of a call type occurred\nin a particular context.\nSecondly, we tested whether call types were produced in similar pro-\nportions in particular contexts, when used in combination with other calls,\ncompared with when produced alone, using paired t tests. For this we used\nthe percentage of a call type that occurred in a particular context. As the\nsample size for some call combinations was small, giving a low statistical\npower compared to the single calls, we tested whether call combinations oc-\ncurred in a particular context more than, and not less than, the component\ncalls.\nTo limit multiple testing we ran one sample t tests only when there was\nat least five percent more calls or drums in a particular context compared\nwith the expected value. We ran paired t tests only when there was at least\n20 percent more call combinations in a particular context compared with the\npercentage of single calls. We then corrected for multiple testing using a\nmodified Bonferroni procedure across the t tests conducted on each call type\n(Hochberg, 1988). Although results of all tests were considered significant\nif p < 0.05, because of low statistical power for some call types we have\ndiscussed values of p < 0.1 after correcting for multiple testing.\nTo test whether call combinations were likely to occur in a particular order\nwe conducted paired t tests on call combinations and combinations with the\nreverse order respectively, such as pant hoot followed by grunt versus grunt\nfollowed by pant hoot.\nThis content downloaded from\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n129.2.89.26 on Tue, 13 Jan 2026 21:27:52 UTC��������������\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms406 Crockford & Boesch\nResults\nDistributions of single and combined calls\n51% of all calls were produced singularly whereas 49% of calls were as\ncombinations (Table 3), with spectrograms of the most commonly produced\nshown in Figure 1.

Only one (laugh) of the 16 call types never\noccurred in a combination.\nIt is evident from Table 4 that the distribution of actual call combinations\ncompared to possible call combinations was non-random. There were a to-\ntal of 88 different signal combinations, which is 41% of all 214 possible\ncombinations. 12 different combinations were produced more than 20 times\nwhereas 56 were produced fewer than five times.\nThe call order of six call combinations was non-random (Table 4). In\n97.5% of all combinations containing a pant hoot, the pant hoot was the\nfirst call in the combination. In other combinations the order was less strict.\nAlthough significantly more hoo and grunts were produced than grunt and\nhoos, 29% of all possible hoo and grunt combinations were produced as\ngrunts and hoos. In fact seven additional combinations and their reverse\norders were each produced at least five times: grunt and bark, grunt and pant,\ngrunt and pant grunt, pant grunt and bark, pant hoot and pant grunt, scream\nand bark, scream and whimper. However sample sizes were too small to\ndetermine whether these combinations were non-randomly produced.\nContextual correlates of single and combined calls\nAll call types occurred in several contexts, with no call type being exclu-\nsively produced in one context. However, single and combined calls showed\ndifferences in their frequency of occurrence across contexts. Although all\ntypes of single and combined calls were produced in at least three contexts,\nsingle calls were generally produced across more contexts. Eight of ten sin-\ngle calls occurred in at least nine contexts whilst this was the case for only\ntwo of ten call combinations (Table 5). In addition, only one of ten single\ncalls was mainly produced in one context or behavioural interaction (>80%\nof all the occurrences of that call type), compared to six of ten different call\ncombinations (Table 7). However, more single call types were produced in\ncertain contexts significantly more than expected, compared with the call\ncombinations (13 and five respectively, Tables 5 & 6 for raw data, & Table 7\nfor statistical results).\nWhen determining whether similar percentages of call combinations were\nproduced in particular contexts compared to the component calls we found\nthat five of the ten combinations were produced in different contexts com-\nThis content downloaded from\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n129.2.89.26 on Tue, 13 Jan 2026 21:27:52 UTC��������������\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms408 Crockford & Boesch\n. .

Pant hoot followed by drums, for exam-\nple, occurred more in travel and aggression contexts than pant hoots alone,\ntravel and aggression being the two contexts which elicited more drums than\nexpected. Second, pant hoot and grunts were produced in the sum of the con-\ntexts of the component calls (Table 8). Pant hoots were produced more than\nexpected in 'responses during feeding and travelling', whilst grunts were\nproduced more than expected in food contexts. Pant hoot and grunts were\nproduced more in 'responses and meeting at food' than expected and in more\n'responses at food' than grunts. Thus pant hoot and grunt is produced in the\nresponse context associated with pant hoots, but only during feeding, the\ncontext associated with grunts. Third, pant hoot and pant grunt combina-\ntions were produced more than either of the component calls in a different\nbut related context - 'meeting at food' (Table 8). Fourth, 'aaa' grunt and\ndeep grunt, a combination of two different grunt types, was produced signif-\nicantly more in food contexts than single grunts, even though single grunts\nwere produced significantly more in food contexts than expected.\nThe only combination in the analysis for which it was possible to test its\nreverse pair, hoo and grunts and grunts and hoos, did not show any signifi-\ncant differences, although Table 5 shows that the distribution of calls across\ncontexts is not the same. Although both occurred in food contexts, grunt and\nhoos occurred more in travel whilst hoo and grunts occurred more in 'meet-\ning at food'. Unfortunately, the small sample sizes of other call combinations\nand their reverse pairs were too small to be included in the analysis.\nDiscussion\nAlmost half of all vocalisations produced by the Tai chimpanzees occurred in\ncombination with other vocalisations or with drums. The combinations were\na non-random selection of possible combinations, some of which occurred in\na specific order. Single calls and call combinations were produced in specific\ncontexts. The contexts in which several combinations were produced differed\nfrom the contexts of at least one of the component calls. The contexts in\nwhich the combinations were produced varied from the component calls\nin five different ways, three of which have not, to our knowledge, been\ndescribed for other animal species. This analysis clearly shows that call\ncombinations are an important aspect of chimpanzee communication.\nThis content downloaded from\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n129.2.89.26 on Tue, 13 Jan 2026 21:27:52 UTC��������������\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms416 Crockford & Boesch\nHalf of all vocalisations and drums were produced as combinations com-\npared to 38% of all calls in wedge-capped capuchins, a species known for\ntheir extensive combining of calls (Robinson, 1984). While most of these\nwere the more stereotyped pant hooting sequences, 19% were combinations\nfrom a range of call types and contexts. The latter is likely to be conservative\nestimate in chimpanzees, as calls were categorised by ear rather than spectro-\ngraphically. Thus, more subtle call combinations or rapid call changes may\nhave been missed. Clearly, call combinations constitute a substantial propor-\ntion of the vocal repertoire of chimpanzees.\nCall combinations were non-randomly produced, a finding also shown\nfor new world monkeys (cotton-top tamarins: Cleveland & Snowdon, 1982;\nwedge-capped capuchins: Robinson, 1984). While few combination types\noccurred frequently (more than 50 times), more than half of the combination\ntypes were rarely produced, less than 5 times in total. This suggests that\nalthough the observation time was probably not long enough to observe all\npossible combinations, a fluid, rather than a rigid, stereotyped, combination\nsystem seems to exist, whereby calls can be combined as contexts arise that\nrequire them.\nAs with other primates, some call combinations were more likely to occur\nin a specific order rather than the reverse order. In cotton-top tamarins, for\nexample, chirps were always followed by whistles (Cleveland & Snowdon,\n1982). In titi monkeys pants followed chirrups but chirrups never followed\npants (Robinson, 1979). Using a playback experiment, Robinson (1979)\nshowed that titi monkeys can discriminate variations in the order of call\ncombinations, as has also been shown for gibbons (Mitani & Marler, 1989),\ngolden-winged warblers (Ficken & Ficken, 1973) and the European robin\n(Bremond, 1968).\nHowever, as pointed out by Robinson (1979), it has not yet been demon-\nstrated in a species other than humans and captive chimpanzees (e.g., Gard-\nner & Gardner, 1969; Premack, 1971), that changing the call order actu-\nally constitutes a difference in the information which is extracted from calls\nby listeners, for example 'chimpanzee hunt' versus 'hunt chimpanzee'. We\nfound that eight call combination types and their reverse orders were pro-\nduced. Further research should test whether call order affects the information\nconveyed to chimpanzees.\nSingle call types were produced broadly, across several contexts. Screams,\nlike barks, occurred more than expected in at least two contexts.

Detailed acoustic analysis of screams\nmay also reveal context specific call types.\nOnly one single call was predominantly produced in a single context.\nIn contrast, more than half of the different call combinations were context\nspecific, each being mainly produced in a single context. One explanation\nfor this is that the act of combining calls refined the likelihood of a particular\ncombination being produced in a particular context.\nThe effect of combining calls altered their contexts of production in five\nways, suggestive of five possible functions that call combinations may have\nrelative to the component calls. Two of these call combinations have already\nbeen documented for other species and are as follows. Some pant hoot and\npant grunts were produced in a context related to, but not the same, as con-\ntexts of the component calls. Similarly, cotton-top tamarins (Cleveland &\nSnowdon, 1982) and wedge-capped capuchins (Robinson, 1984) call combi-\nnations have been described as occurring in contexts intermediary to those of\nthe component calls, constituting an early form of lexical syntax. The 'aaa'\ngrunt and deep grunt combinations would seem to have a message intensi-\nfication function, as described for wolves (Schassburger, 1993). Again, this\nconstitutes an early form of lexical syntax.\nThree remaining putative functions of the call combinations found in\nchimpanzees, to our knowledge have not yet been described for other ani-\nmal species. First, the pant hoot and pant grunt combination, a longer range\nand a shorter range call respectively, may convey information simultaneously\nto different audiences. The combination is produced exclusively by females\nin TaY, specifically while greeting males during meeting contexts (Tables 3\n& 4). The pant hoot usually starts as the female joins the new party whilst the\npant grunt part only begins during the final approach to the male. As such,\nthe pant hoot part may announce her arrival to the party as a whole and the\npant grunt act as a greeting, exclusively directed at the male. Other combina-\ntions, not included in the analysis for reasons of sample size, may function\nsimilarly.\nSecond, the pant hoot and grunt combinations, produced in the sum of\nthe contexts of the component calls, might convey information about co-\noccurring, rather than intermediary, contexts, such that both contexts are\ncombined in a purely additive fashion. Thus, two pieces of information can\nThis content downloaded from\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n129.2.89.26 on Tue, 13 Jan 2026 21:27:52 UTC��������������\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/terms418 Crockford & Boesch\nbe decoded simultaneously, rather than just one. This would fit the descrip-\ntion of lexical syntax (Marler, 1977), however not as a form of contextual\nmodification (Robinson, 1984).\nA third, possibly related, function may explain why pant hoots are mainly\ncombined with all other long distance calls and drums, but rarely with short\ndistance calls. The main context of production of pant hoots was in response\nto hearing chimpanzees in another party. Three of five of the combination\ntypes with a pant hoot were produced in other contexts, however, as if the\npant hoot 'loses' its context of production (pant hoot and drum, pant hoot\nand scream and drum, pant hoot and pant grunt). It might be that the func-\ntion of the pant hoot changes, or that we have wrongly inferred the func-\ntion of single pant hoots from their contexts of production. Pant hoots are\nknown to encode individual and community differences (Marler & Hobbett,\n1975; Crockford et al., 2004). Anecdotally, they are the easiest vocalisation\nby which researchers can identify out-of-sight chimpanzees, although encod-\ning of individuality in other chimpanzee calls has not yet been examined. In\naddition, although pant hoots are combined with a range of other calls and\ndrums, they are produced almost exclusively at the beginning of combina-\ntions. Furthermore, barks produced in combination with drums are produced\nspecifically in either travel or neighbour encounter contexts (Crockford &\nBoesch, 2003). Barks and drums are also often combined with pant hoots\n(Table 5).\nWe hypothesise then that pant hoots act as signature calls for signallers,\nwhich can be combined with context information in the calls or drums which\nfollow. If this is the case, this may represent a primitive form of 'agent'\ncombined with 'context'. Again this suggests an additive function, where two\npieces of information can be decoded instead of one, such that the complexity\nof information available for decoding is increased.\nFinally, one function discussed in the literature, was not found in chim-\npanzees. This is where combined calls were produced in completely different\ncontexts to those of the component calls, such as in gibbon song (Mitani &\nMarler, 1989), in other words constituting an early form of phonological syn-\ntax (Marler, 1977). The evidence in this study goes against Marler (1977)'s\nsuggestion, that chimpanzees' apparently stereotyped pant hoot sequences\ndemonstrate a primitive form of phonological syntax.\nSeveral of the call combinations that we have found in chimpanzees fit the\nbroad descriptions so far offered for lexical syntax (Marler, 1977; Robinson,\nThis content downloaded from\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n�\n129.2.89.26 on Tue, 13 Jan 2026 21:27:52 UTC��������������\nAll use subject to https://about.jstor.org/termsCall combinations in chimpanzees 419\n1984). The term lexical syntax may be appropriate for human language,\nhowever, it is clearly too broad a term to discriminate between the different\ntypes of combinations that we have so far seen in chimpanzees. Careful\ntesting using playback experiments, such as those conducted by Zuberbuhler\n(2002), of each component signal and of the call combination, is required\nto determine what information is really conveyed by single calls, and how\nthis changes when calls are used in combination. Only then can we begin to\ncompare apparent forms of lexical syntax found in animal communication\nwith those found in human languages, and so determine if roots of human\nlanguage or language abilities exist in animal communication.\nCall combinations clearly make up a substantial part of the chimpanzee\nrepertoire. By analysing the contexts in which call combinations were pro-\nduced compared with the information conveyed by each call singularly we\nhave highlighted five possible functions of call combinations. Two resem-\nbled those described for other species, whilst three represent novel functions.\nTwo of the three may have an additive function, such that two pieces of in-\nformation can be conveyed simultaneously, increasing message complexity.\nAlthough the functions of these call combinations remain to be tested, it\nseems likely in chimpanzees that call combinations serve several functions,\nall of which enable listeners to extract more precise information about the\nsignaller or the current situation of the signaller. Since so many different call\ncombinations were used, call combinations must provide a rich source of\ninformation. It seems highly likely that we are and will continue to under-\nestimate the types and complexity of information conveyed in chimpanzee\ncalls until the information content of call combinations is tested. In addition,\nsuch an analysis may be crucial for determining whether or not the roots of\nhuman language date back to when humans last shared a common ancestor\nwith chimpanzees, some 4-6 million years ago.\nAcknowledgements\nWe thank the 'Ministere de la Recherche Scientifique', the 'Ministere de l'Agriculture et des\nRessource Animales' of Cote d'Lvoire, the director of the Tai National Park and the 'Projet\nAutonome pour la Conservation du Parc National de TaM' for permission to conduct this\nstudy.

Little is known\nabout the factors that determine how whales learn from\ntheir auditory experiences. Song learning in birds is better\nunderstood and appears to be constrained by stable core\nattributes such as species-specific sound repertoires and\nsong syntax. To clarify whether similar constraints exist\nfor song learning by humpbacks, we analyzed changes\nover 14 years in the sounds used by humpback whales\nsinging in Hawaiian waters. We found that although the\nproperties of individual sounds within songs are quite\nvariable over time, the overall distribution of certain\nacoustic features within the repertoire appears to be stable.\nIn particular, our findings suggest that species-specific\nconstraints on temporal features of song sounds determine\nsong form, whereas spectral variability allows whales to\nflexibly adapt song elements.\nKeywords Baleen whale . Sounds . Acoustic . Mysticete .\nSong learning\nIntroduction\nInsects, humans, frogs, birds, and whales produce a wide\nvariety of structured sound sequences, commonly described as songs. Some animals (e.g., birds) learn to sing\nspecific songs based on their sensorimotor experiences\nduring development, whereas others (most notably humans) can learn to sing new songs throughout adulthood.\nExperimental studies of song learning in birds have\nrevealed that experience-dependent song variation during\ndevelopment is often constrained by stable core attributes\nsuch as species-specific sound repertoires and song syntax\n(Marler 1997). Song development in birds typically\ninvolves progression toward a final adult song (or set of\nsongs) that “crystallizes,” becoming fixed in structure and\ncontent. Song learning in adult humans is clearly more\nflexible than in adult birds and may therefore depend on\nsubstantially different learning mechanisms. It is not yet\nclear whether any species learns to sing in ways that are\ncomparable to humans.\nSong learning is a special case of vocal learning, and\nvocal learning can be viewed as a special kind of imitation.\nRelatively few mammals have the ability to imitate either\nsounds or actions (reviewed by Whiten 1992; Janik and\nSlater 1997; Caldwell and Whiten 2002; Herman 2002),\nlimiting the species that could potentially be used in\nstudies of song learning. Based on currently available data,\nthere appears to be only one group of mammals other than\nhumans that can vocally imitate: marine mammals. In\nparticular, bottlenose dolphins spontaneously imitate\nsounds in their environment (Reiss and McCowan 1993)\nand can be trained to imitate sounds on command\n(Richards et al. 1984). Most cetaceans do not naturally\nlearn to sing, and it is questionable whether it would be\npossible to teach cetaceans to produce rhythmic sound\nsequences. There are a small number of cetacean species\nthat do naturally sing, however, all of which are baleen\nwhales (for review, see Clark 1990; Edds-Walton 1997).\nThe extent to which baleen whales (mysticetes) learn\nthe songs they sing is largely unknown. The best evidence\nof mysticete song learning has been obtained from\nElectronic Supplementary Material Supplementary material is\navailable for this article at http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10071-004-\n0238-7.\nE.

All studies\nof song learning in humpback whales to date have been\nobservational, consisting of subjective comparisons of\nsound sequences produced underwater by singing whales\nand recorded at a distance using hydrophones (e.g., see\nWinn et al. 1970, 1981; Payne and McVay 1971; Winn\nand Winn 1978; Payne et al. 1983; Payne and Guinee\n1983; Payne and Payne 1985). These studies have\nrevealed that humpback whale songs consist of a cyclical\npattern of several “themes” made of repeated “phrases,”\nwhich in turn consist of individual sound “units”; songs\nare repeated continuously within a “song session.”\nConsecutive songs sung by a whale within a song session\nare not identical, typically differing in total duration and in\nthe number of times phrases of specific themes are\nrepeated. Songs may also differ in theme composition\n(Payne et al. 1983; Helweg et al. 1990). Singing humpback whales progressively modify theme and phrase\ncharacteristics throughout a single season and from one\nyear to the next (Payne et al. 1983; Payne and Payne\n1985). Even so, at any given time, songs produced within\na population are highly similar, suggesting that singers\ncopy one another (Guinee et al. 1983; Payne et al. 1983;\nPayne and Payne 1985). In contrast, the specific themes\nand phrases within songs produced by geographically\nseparated populations may differ greatly (Winn et al. 1981;\nPayne and Guinee 1983; Helweg et al. 1990, 1998).\nUnlike most songbirds, developing humpback whales\ndo not converge on a species-typical song. Rather,\nhumpbacks progressively change their songs throughout\ntheir lives. Humpback whale songs also differ from bird\nsongs in that they usually last for 10 min or more, whereas\nbird songs typically last a few seconds; and humpback\nwhale songs are repeated continuously without intervening\npauses, whereas bird songs are usually separated by silent\nperiods (Payne and McVay 1971). Although similarities\nbetween singing whales and singing humans have been\nreported (Gray et al. 2001), whale songs are clearly more\nconstrained in structure and content than songs produced\nby humans. The rules that constrain the form of humpback\nwhale songs are only beginning to be identified.\nOne “universal” rule of humpback whale song formation is that themes within a song will progress in a fixed\nsequence. Sequential ordering of themes is so typical that\nsongs that do not follow this pattern are called aberrant\nsongs (Frumhoff 1983). Other features of humpback whale\nsongs are sufficiently prototypical that experienced\ninvestigators can recognize recordings as being from a\nsinging humpback without hearing a complete song or\ntheme. These recognizable features have yet to be\nquantitatively defined but appear to depend on subjective\nimpressions of the timbre of units, as well as the\nspectrotemporal structure of phrases.\nPhrase structure in humpback whale songs is much\nmore flexible than in bird songs and can even be\nprogressively modified within individual songs (described\nby Payne and Payne, 1985, as shifting themes). In shifting\nthemes, units within phrases can change in number,\nfrequency, frequency modulation, duration, and rate of\nproduction. Some themes are composed of more stable\nphrases, which are repeated almost identically within\nindividual songs (Payne and Payne 1985; Mercado et al.\n2003). In contrast, other themes consist of sound\nsequences with no apparent structure (Payne and Payne\n1985). The sound repertoire used by singing humpback\nwhales appears to be continuously changing over time\n(Tyack 1981; Payne et al. 1983; Payne and Payne 1985).\nCato (1991) noted that changes in the sound types\nproduced by Australian humpback whales across just 2\nyears (1983–1985) were so pronounced that “they had to\nbe considered to be new sound types, even though they\nmay have evolved from the old ones” (p. 286). There are\nno reports of adult birds using such dynamic sound\nrepertoires to construct their songs.\nAlthough phrases within humpback whale songs are\nhighly dynamic, recent analyses have revealed that both\nshifting and stable phrases can recur across populations\nand decades (Mercado et al. 2003). The first such phrase to\nbe reported is known as a surface ratchet. This phrase is\ncontinuously modified throughout production within a\ntheme, is frequently correlated with surfacing by a singing\nwhale, and has been recorded near Hawaii (Helweg et al.\n1990), the West Indies (Payne and Payne 1985), Australia\n(Cato 1991), and Mexico (Cerchio et al. 2001). Other\nrecurrent phrases include a stable two-unit pattern\nrecorded in the West Indies (Payne and McVay 1971)\nand Hawaii (McSweeney et al. 1989; Mercado et al.\n2003), and a more complex multi-unit pattern recorded in\nthe West Indies (Winn and Winn 1978), Australia (Mednis\n1991), and Hawaii (Mercado et al. 2003). The discovery of\nthese universal patterns suggests that elements of humpback whale songs are more tightly constrained than\nsuggested by prior subjective analyses of song structure.\nA better understanding of which features of humpback\nwhale songs are learned, versus which features are species\ntypical, is needed to assess whether song copying by\nwhales involves mechanisms comparable to those used by\nbirds or humans.\nTo clarify this issue, we analyzed the variability of song\nunits produced by humpback whales in Hawaii over 14\nyears. The acoustic characteristics of humpback whale\nsong units were measured in detail from waveform and\nspectrographic representations and compared within and\nacross years. Unlike prior multi-year analyses of humpback whale song that focused on changes in song structure\nobserved in songs recorded from long distances (Payne\nand Payne 1985; Cato 1991), we focused exclusively on\nanalyzing the basic acoustic properties of individual units\nwithin songs recorded from nearby singers. Variations in\nthe acoustic characteristics of units over time were\nevaluated to derive a quantitative as well as a subjective\nevaluation of song unit variability. Consistent with past\nreports, we observed that the sound repertoire used within\nhumpback whale songs varied substantially across years.\nAdditionally, our findings suggest that the sound repertoire\nused by singing humpback whales is more tightly\nconstrained in the temporal domain than in the spectral\ndomain. We speculate that singing humpback whales are\n94\nselecting spectral modulations within a species-specific\ntemporal template based on their experiences.\nMethods\nMaterials\nHumpback whale songs were recorded at a number of\nlocations in Hawaii from 1981 to 1995 by researchers\nfrom the Kewalo Basin Marine Mammal Laboratory in\nHonolulu. Most recordings were made near the Kawaihae\nHarbor on the northwestern coast of the island of Hawaii,\nin waters less than 180 m deep. Recordings collected from\n1992 to 1995 were made using an uncalibrated Labcore\ncustomized hydrophone (sensitive to 12 kHz) attached to\nan Archer customized mini-amplifier (catalog no. 227-\n1008B) that was connected to a Marantz cassette recorder\n(Model PMD430, frequency flat to 17 kHz). The\nhydrophones and recording equipment used to make\nrecordings in other years varied but reportedly all had\nfrequency responses flat from 50 Hz to 10,000 Hz.\nRecordings were made by deploying a hydrophone from a\nsmall boat positioned less than 50 m from the singing\nwhale. Recording singers from short distances minimized\npropagation-related distortion (e.g., absorption, multipathing) of recorded units. The quality of these recordings was\ninitially assessed through aural and spectrographic inspection. One hundred tapes, containing approximately 50 h of\nrecorded humpback whale song, were evaluated using a\nrating system based on signal amplitude level, amount of\nintermittent noise, amount of constant noise, and presence\nof multiple singers. A sample of 35 recordings was then\nselected from these tapes based on their quality (e.g.,\nsignal-to-noise ratio), the year and month in which they\nwere recorded, and their duration. Thirty-seven songs were\nisolated from these recordings for analysis; 4 songs were\nisolated for each year from 1985 to 1989 and from 1992 to\n1995, and 1 song was isolated from 1981. Although only a\nsmall sample of high-quality recordings was available for\nanalysis, songs from each year were highly similar and\nthus are likely representative of other songs produced in\nHawaii during the same year. Recordings were not\navailable from 1982 to 1984 and 1990 to 1992. For\nsome years (1985, 1987, 1994) during which only a few\nhigh-quality recordings were made, 2 songs were taken\nfrom a single recording (i.e., sounds were sampled from 2\nsongs produced by an individual whale). It is unlikely that\nother sampled songs included whales that were rerecorded on different occasions, because singers are\nseldom recorded in the same area twice (Guinee et al.\n1983; Payne and Payne 1985; Cerchio et al. 2001). The\npossibility remains that one or more whales were rerecorded on separate occasions, which could potentially\nbias comparisons between years. Note that this bias would\napply equally to all acoustic measures and therefore should\nnot affect variability between measures.\nTapes were played back using a Marantz cassette\nrecorder Model PMD430 with a frequency response flat to\n17 kHz (±3 dB). The signal from the cassette recorder was\nTable 1 Abbreviations of descriptors.

Calculation of PRRMN\ndiffered for short-duration and long-duration units. For long-duration units, six IPI samples were reduced to three intermediate values\ncorresponding to the mean of the first and second, third and fourth, and fifth and sixth samples so that comparisons with shorter units could\nbe made. PRR estimates were obtained for each of the three IPI values by calculating the number of IPIs that would occur over 1 s (e.g., an\nIPI of 10 ms would give a PRR estimate of 100 pulses per second, or 0.1 kpps). PRRMN was then calculated by averaging the three PRR\nestimates. DPRR1 was calculated by subtracting the first PRR estimate from the second, and DPPR2 was calculated by subtracting the\nsecond PRR estimate from the third. Calculation of DPKHZ differed for short-duration and long-duration units. Three PKHZ samples\ncollected for long-duration units were reduced to two intermediate values corresponding to the mean of the first and second sample and the\nmean of the second and third sample, again to allow for comparisons with shorter units. DPKHZ was then calculated by subtracting the\nsecond PKHZ measurement, corresponding to the second half of the unit, from the first PKHZ measurement. DNRG1 and DNRG2 were\ncalculated by dividing energy measurements from the lower, middle, and upper frequency bands by the total energy of the unit, and then\ndifferences between these ratios were determined.\n95\nfed directly into the sound input of an Apple PowerMacintosh 7100/80 computer. Waveforms and spectrograms were produced on the Macintosh using Canary\nsoftware (version 1.2B) from the Cornell Laboratory of\nOrnithology (Bioacoustics Research Program). A sampling rate of 22.05 kHz was used for all analyses and\nspectrograms were made using a filter bandwidth of\n43.7 Hz. The SAS statistical analysis program (version\n6.08), running on an IBM 9121 mainframe computer, was\nused for all statistical analyses.\nProcedure\nSongs were initially assessed for thematic structure\nthrough repeated aural analyses. This involved identifying\nsets of repeated sound patterns and noting where on the\nrecording the singing whale transitioned from one pattern\nto the next. Exemplary phrases were then selected from\neach theme based on clarity (i.e., signal-to-noise ratio) and\naural distinctiveness from previous phrases. Individual\nunits were extracted from these phrases. Transitional units\n(sounds typically found at the junction of two themes) and\nunits that occurred only once within a song were also\nincluded in the sample. The goal of this purposive\nsampling technique was to characterize the range of\nindividual sound variability present within each song.\nSeveral quantitative measures were collected from each\nunit. Measurements of temporal characteristics such as\nunit duration and the duration of silence after a unit were\ncollected from waveforms. Estimates of the pulse-repetition rate within a unit were obtained by measuring the\nduration of inter-pulse intervals sampled from the beginning, middle, and end of the waveform (i.e., the approximate first, second, and last third of the waveform). More\nextensive measurements were collected from spectrograms\nincluding time of peak signal amplitude, maximum and\nminimum frequency, frequency with peak energy overall,\nfrequency with peak energy during the first and second\nhalf of the unit, total energy, and distribution of energy\nacross the upper, middle, and lower bandwidth of the unit.\nThe precision of frequency measurements was constrained\nby the sensitivities of the tape playback system (described\nabove).\nData Analysis\nTwelve variables were used to describe individual units\nsampled from humpback whale songs, including 6 temporal descriptors based on waveform measurements and 6\nspectral descriptors based on spectrographic measurements\n(see Table 1). All unit descriptors were either direct\nmeasurements or calculated values derived from direct\nmeasurements.\nThe range of measured values for each descriptor was\ndivided into 21 intervals. The number of units having\nacoustic features falling within the boundaries of each\ninterval was then tabulated to form frequency distributions\nfor each descriptor (i.e., each frequency distribution was\nrepresented by a 21-element vector, Table 2). Frequency\ndistributions of measured sound characteristics were used\nto evaluate quantitatively the overall variability of sound\nrepertoires both within and across years. The variability of\na particular descriptor over time was first evaluated by\ncomparing frequency distributions from each individual\nyear with the distribution representing all measurements of\nthat descriptor from all years. Frequency distributions\nwere normalized by dividing each vector element by the\nstandard deviation of the vector elements. The difference\nbetween two distributions (D) was then calculated by\ntaking the square root of the sum of the squared\ndifferences between the corresponding elements of the\ntwo distribution vectors to be compared, a Euclidean\ndistance measure (see Table 2). Two identical distribution\nvectors would result in D equaling zero, and the\nmagnitude of D for non-identical distributions reflects\nthe geometric distance between the vectors representing\nTable 2 Process of converting frequency distributions into vector representations (example).

The distance between two\nvectors was then calculated using a Euclidean distance measure.\n96\nthe two frequency distributions. Pair-wise comparisons\nbetween frequency distributions from individual years\nwere also calculated to assess the cumulative variability\nover time. Mean correlations were calculated by first\nconverting correlation coefficients to z scores (Corey et al.\n1998). The statistical significance of mean differences\nbetween distributions of distance measures was assessed\nwith t tests.\nResults\nA total of 813 units was sampled from the 37 songs\nselected for this analysis. The mean number of units\ncollected per year was 81±15.8 (hereafter, the number\nfollowing ± refers to the standard deviation) and the mean\nnumber of units collected per song was 21±5.8. The\nnumber of units collected from each song ranged from 8 to\nFig. 1 Temporal characteristics\nof all units sampled from\nhumpback whale songs recorded\nin 1993, shown in the order that\nunits were sampled. Note that\nthe number of units sampled\nfrom each recording differed by\nno more than one unit. Both a\nunit duration and b the duration\nof silence separating units decreased with song progression.\n97\n30; the number of units sampled generally reflected the\nnumber of themes present within a particular song. When\ncomparable numbers of themes were present in all songs\nfrom a particular year, the number of units sampled from\neach song was highly similar (see Fig. 1). The mean\nnumber of phrases isolated from each song was 6.6±1.5,\nand the mean number of units collected from each phrase\nwas 3.2±1.6. Songs recorded on different days within a\nparticular year typically contained different subsets of the\nthemes produced within that year, precluding detailed\nwithin-year analyses of repertoire variability. The one\nexception was songs recorded in 1993, all of which\ncontained the same nine phrases. In all songs from 1993, a\nsystematic decrease in unit duration with song progression\nwas apparent (r98=−0.5, P<0.001; Fig. 1a); intervals of\nsilence following units decreased as well (r98=−0.3,\nP=0.0005; Fig. 1b). No progressive changes in either\nmaximum frequency (r98=−0.1, P=0.3; see S1a in the\nsupplementary material) or peak frequency (r98=0.04,\nP=0.7; see S1b) were evident.\nWithin-year comparisons of samples collected from\nsongs recorded in 1993 provide a measure of the\nconsistency in unit features recorded during a single year\nas well as a measure of the reliability of the purposive\nsampling technique used in this study. For example,\ndistributions of the durations of units and associated silent\nintervals were highly similar across recordings. The mean\ncorrelation between distributions of duration measurements in 1993 (mean ± SD, n=6: 0.96±0.02) accounted for\n92% of the common variance, and the mean correlation\nbetween distributions of interval measurements (mean ±\nSD, n=6: 0.97±0.03), accounted for 94%. These high\nlevels of consistency indicate that the sampling techniques\nused in this study were reliable, and that the temporal\nfeatures of singers’ sound repertoires in 1993 were stable.\nInterestingly, two spectral descriptors that might be\nexpected to correlate (maximum frequency and peak\nfrequency) showed less consistency across recordings. The\nmean correlation between distributions of peak frequency\nmeasurements (mean ± SD, n=6: 0.83±0.2) accounted for\n70% of the common variance, and the mean correlation\nbetween distributions of maximum frequency measurements (mean ± SD, n=6: 0.50±0.4) accounted for only\n25% of the common variance. These differences (see S2\nfor details) illustrate how basic acoustic measures can\nprovide evidence of differential stability in the unit\nproperties used by singing humpback whales.\nConsistent with prior reports (e.g., Winn and Winn\n1978), unit comparisons based on subjective aural\nanalyses and visual inspections of spectrograms across\nFig. 2 Overall frequency distributions of temporal characteristics, including sounds\nsampled from 1981 to 1995. See\nTable 1 for abbreviations.\n98\nconsecutive years revealed considerable overlap in the\nsound repertoires being used, whereas comparisons across\nnon-consecutive years revealed fewer similarities. When\nrepresentative spectrograms from songs separated by\nseveral years were compared, it was difficult to match\nunits across years with confidence. Additionally, spectrographic analyses were sometimes misleading in that units\nthat looked similar in spectrograms seemed dissimilar\nwhen analyzed aurally. Aural analyses of the variability of\nunits sampled from different years generally corresponded\nwell with spectrographic analyses but revealed more\nsubjective variability than was apparent from spectrograms.\nFrequency distributions of the quantitative measures of\ntemporal descriptors for each year (see S3), and across all\nyears (Fig. 2), were primarily unimodal. The duration of\nunits within songs varied widely, ranging between 40 ms\nand 13.1 s. Most units were shorter than 2.0 s in duration\n(mean ± SD: 1.8±1.8 s; median: 1.2). Interestingly, the\ninterval of silence following units within humpback whale\nsongs was distributed similarly to unit duration. In\nparticular, the range (0.1–8.0 s) and mean duration (1.7\n±0.9) of silent intervals following units within songs were\nsimilar to those of unit duration; most silent intervals were\nless than 3.0 s in duration (median: 1.6). The point in time\nat which an individual unit reached its peak energy level\nwas quite variable. Typically, units reached their peak\nenergy about halfway through production of the unit. The\nmean pulse-repetition rate ranged between 0.01 kpps and\n4.67 kpps (kilo-pulses/second), with a mean of 0.4\n±0.5 kpps. Changes in the pulse-repetition rate from the\nbeginning to the middle of the unit, and from the middle to\nthe end of the unit, showed similar distributions. The\npulse-repetition rate of most units remained relatively\nconstant, with a slight tendency to increase rather than\ndecrease.\nFrequency distributions of the quantitative measures of\nspectral descriptors also tended to be unimodal both within\nyears (see S4), and across years (Fig. 3). As might be\nexpected, the distribution of minimum sound frequency\nwas similar to the distribution of mean pulse-repetition\nrate, ranging between 0.0 and 3.97 kHz (where 0 kHz\nrepresents the limit at the bottom of the spectrographic\ndisplay), with most units having a minimum frequency\nbelow 400 Hz. Maximum frequency varied greatly, with\nmost units having a maximum frequency above 3 kHz but\nFig. 3 Overall frequency distributions of spectral characteristics, including sounds sampled\nfrom 1981 to 1995. See Table 1\nfor abbreviations.\n99\nbelow 8 kHz. The distribution of frequencies with peak\nenergy was broad, with a large peak at around 200 Hz, and\na substantial number of units with peak frequencies\nbetween 500 and 2,000 Hz. Changes in peak frequency\nparalleled those seen for changes in pulse-repetition rate.\nMost changes were less than ±400 Hz, suggesting that\npeak frequencies typically were constant from the\nbeginning to the end of most units. The change in energy\nfrom the lower to the middle frequency band was highly\nvariable, ranging from a halving in energy to a doubling.\nOverall, units typically had less energy in the middle band\nthan the lower band. About one-third of the units,\nhowever, had greater energy in the middle band than in\nthe lower band. Changes in energy from the middle to the\nupper band were less variable, with most units showing\ndecreased energy in the upper band compared to the\nmiddle band.\nDistributions of temporal descriptors subjectively were\nless variable across years than distributions of spectral\ndescriptors (compare S3 and S4). Statistical tests\nperformed on distance measures characterizing differences\nin frequency distributions (summarized in Table 3) confirmed that spectral descriptors were more variable than\ntemporal descriptors (t39=−10.4, p=1.0×10−12; see Fig. 4).\nDifferences between distributions from different years did\nnot vary consistently as a function of the span between the\nyears being compared (i.e., increasing the number of years\nseparating the samples did not increase the difference\nbetween distributions of the sound features measured from\nthose samples).\nDiscussion\nHumpback whales appear to copy features of songs they\nare exposed to (Guinee et al. 1983; Payne and Payne 1985)\nand occasionally may copy entire songs (Noad et al.\n2000). Unlike singing birds, adult humpback whales\nprogressively modify their songs on a yearly basis\n(Payne and Payne 1985), never settling either on a\npredictable song structure or on a stable sound repertoire.\nPast studies have described how the structural features of\nhumpback whale songs change over time (Winn and Winn\n1978; Payne and Payne 1985; Cato 1991). Our results\nprovide the first quantitative assessment of cross-year\nvariability in the sound repertoire used by singing\nhumpback whales. Although singing humpbacks continuously modify the repertoire of units they use (Winn and\nWinn 1978; Guinee et al. 1983; Payne et al. 1983; Payne\nand Payne 1985; Cato 1991), they appear to do so within\nthe boundaries of acoustic constraints that are stable for at\nleast a decade.\nBecause we used purposive sampling techniques to\ncharacterize units produced by humpback whales from a\nrestricted locale, we cannot yet determine whether the\nvariability that we observed is representative of humpback\nwhales around the world. Our main goal in using this\ntechnique was to characterize repertoire variability over\ntime within a subpopulation of whales. Past analyses of\nhumpback whale songs have been limited to structural\nanalyses in part because when recordings are made from a\ndistance, propagation within complex shallow water\nenvironments distorts the acoustic properties of individual\nTable 3 Distance between\noverall distribution and distribution for each year\nDescriptor Distance from Mean ± SD\n1995 1994 1993 1992 1989 1988 1987 1986 1985 1981\nDNRG1 5.2 2.7 4.4 6.5 4.4 7.4 8.3 5.0 4.3 7.1 5.5±1.7\nMAXHZ 5.4 4.3 4.4 4.7 5.8 4.7 4.9 4.8 5.9 8.0 5.3±1.1\nTIMPK 3.7 3.5 2.7 4.7 3.3 4.3 3.2 4.2 4.9 3.8 3.8±0.7\nPKHZ 2.7 3.8 2.9 3.0 3.3 4.7 5.6 3.2 3.0 3.4 3.6±0.9\nDNRG2 1.7 1.0 1.2 8.1 1.0 3.1 5.7 1.2 1.6 3.3 2.8±2.4\nPRRMN 2.4 1.5 1.8 1.5 2.1 3.2 2.0 1.9 2.6 2.9 2.2±0.6\nMINHZ 1.5 1.3 1.5 1.2 1.2 1.9 2.4 2.7 1.7 3.4 1.9±0.7\nDUR 1.6 1.2 2.1 0.7 2.3 1.7 2.5 1.6 1.7 2.1 1.8±0.5\nINT 1.9 1.7 1.5 1.0 1.3 2.1 1.6 1.2 2.4 1.6 1.6±0.4\nDPKHZ 0.6 0.7 0.7 0.7 0.6 0.9 0.7 0.6 0.9 1.4 0.8±0.3\nDPRR2 0.6 0.4 0.9 0.7 0.7 0.5 0.7 1.2 0.9 0.7 0.7±0.2\nDPRR1 0.7 0.8 0.9 0.6 0.4 0.8 0.6 0.3 1.1 0.7 0.7±0.2\nFig. 4 The distance between frequency distributions from individual years was greater for spectral descriptors (t39=−10.4, P<0.001)\nthan for temporal descriptors. Bars represent the mean distance, and\nerror bars represent standard error\n100\nunits (Mercado and Frazer 1999; Mercado et al. 2000).\nWhen recordings are made from nearby whales, as in the\ncurrent study, more veridical records of the units produced\nwithin songs can be obtained, facilitating detailed quantitative comparisons between units. Because humpback\nwhale song units are loud, reaching levels of 155–189 dB\nre 1 μPa (Richardson et al. 1995; Au et al. 2001; Pack et\nal. 2003), signal-to-noise levels within a 50-m radius of a\nsolo singer are quite high.\nGiven that singing humpback whales are continuously\nmodifying the repertoire of sounds they use, it is tempting\nto infer that they are continuously copying the units that\nthey hear being produced by other whales. An alternative\npossibility, however, is that the acoustic morphology of\nunits that are suitable for use in songs is constrained by\npreexisting circuitry within the humpback whale brain,\nand that the sound repertoire singers use within a particular\nyear represents a selected subset of this repertoire. Marler\n(1997) suggested that such “learning by selection” can\nexplain how most birds learn their songs. Behavioral\nevidence supportive of this neuroselective model in birds\nincludes the facts that (1) few experiences are needed for\nbirds to memorize a song; (2) birds favor conspecific\nsongs; and (3) large-scale analyses of song variation show\nevidence of acoustic universals (Marler 1997). Although it\nis not known how many times a whale needs to hear a\nsong (or song components) before being able to reproduce\nit, or how many different songs an adult whale hears in\nany given year, recent reports suggest that whales can\nlearn entire songs after minimal exposure (Noad et al.\n2000). There are no reports of humpbacks producing the\nsongs or sounds of other species. Recent large-scale\nanalyses of song structure have revealed universal phrase\nstructures that are used by whales across years and\npopulations (Mercado et al. 2003). Our findings here\nsuggest that temporal features of individual units used by\nhumpback whales singing in Hawaii are highly stable\nacross years and thus may reflect innate constraints on the\nphonology of song elements.\nWe found several properties of humpback whale song\nunits not noted in prior reports: (1) the pacing of unit\nproduction within humpback whale songs is consistent\nacross years; (2) units are most likely to reach peak\namplitude halfway through production of the unit, rather\nthan at the beginning or end; (3) the frequency with peak\nenergy within a unit is often in the middle of the band of\nfrequencies spanned by the unit and is only weakly\nconstrained by the position of the fundamental frequency;\n(4) temporal features of sound types and subsequent silent\nintervals may be progressively modulated within individual songs; and (5) distributions of spectral characteristics\nvary more than distributions of temporal characteristics\nboth within and across years.\nIt is unclear whether spectral variability within and\nacross years reflects individual differences in sound\nproduction, individuals modulating the spectral features\nof their sounds to accommodate the particular environmental context within which they are singing, an artifact of\nthe position of the recording hydrophone relative to the\norientation and depth of the singing whale (Au et al.\n2003), or some combination of these factors. What is clear\nis that humpback whales listening to songs from distances\nof more than 100 m will experience even greater spectral\nvariability, because of distorting propagation (Mercado\nand Frazer 1999; Frazer and Mercado 2000). Listening\nwhales hear songs in a wide variety of locations and from\nvarious distances. Consequently, the spectral features of\nsong units that listening whales receive will be less\npredictable than the temporal characteristics.\nSinging humpback whales probably do not attempt to\nreplicate the distorted versions of song units that they\nreceive. The existence of predefined phonological templates would greatly ease the reconstruction of distorted\nsong units. If such templates are represented within\nhumpback whales’ auditory processing systems, then\nthey do not appear to constrain song units to contain\nparticular frequencies. Singing birds are known to produce\nsounds with stereotypical spectral features (reviewed by\nCatchpole and Slater 1995), and to be highly sensitive to\nabsolute differences in frequency content (Weisman et al.\n1998). Birds do not easily recognize sounds transposed\nacross frequency ranges (Hulse and Cynx 1985), whereas\nhumans and bottlenose dolphins are known to be able to\ntranspose complex sounds immediately from one frequency range to another (Richards et al. 1984; Ralston and\nHerman 1995). The ability to recognize and classify\nsounds independent of their specific spectral content may\nthus play a more important role in song learning by\nhumpback whales than in song learning by birds.\nSinging humpback whales use a graded repertoire of\nunits that they continuously modify over time and vary\ntheir song sound repertoire in such a way that the\ndistributions of temporal acoustic features within the\nrepertoire remain stable. Humpback whale songs include\nseveral universal features including sequential ordering of\nphrases, stereotypical structuring of certain phrases, and\nstereotypical timing of unit production. Spectral features\nof distinctive units within songs are only weakly\nconstrained, whereas frequency and amplitude modulation\nwithin sound types is more predictable. These properties\nof humpback whale song suggest that individual whales\nselect patterns and units to include in songs based on their\nrecent experience. Song copying by humpback whales\nappears to be an open process in the spectral domain in\nthat specific frequencies are not used by all individuals\nwithin or across years. In contrast, the temporal and\nstructural stability of humpback whale songs suggests that\nspecies-specific constraints on these properties strongly\ndetermine song form. These constraints likely relate to the\nfunction(s) of humpback whale songs, which remain\nunknown.\n101\nAcknowledgements We are most grateful to the many researchers\nand volunteers at the Kewalo Basin Marine Mammal Laboratory\nwho took part in obtaining the recordings analyzed in this study.

We compared the acoustic\nstructure of predatory-induced songs with regular songs that were given as part of their daily routine. Predator-induced songs\nwere identical to normal songs in the call note repertoire, but we found consistent differences in how the notes were\nassembled into songs. The responses of out-of-sight receivers demonstrated that these syntactic differences were meaningful\nto conspecifics. Our study provides the first evidence of referential signalling in a free-ranging ape species, based on\na communication system that utilises combinatorial rules.\nCitation: Clarke E, Reichard UH, Zuberbu ̈ hler K (2006) The Syntax and Meaning of Wild Gibbon Songs. PLoS ONE 1(1): e73. doi:10.1371/\njournal.pone.0000073\nINTRODUCTION\nPrimates typically produce acoustic signals when detecting\na predator, such as a raptor, large cat, or snake. These\nvocalisations are termed alarm calls, which function to warn other\ngroup members and sometimes also to communicate directly to\nthe predator, for example to attract its attention or advertise\nperception [1]. For some primates, there is good evidence for\nreference-like communication. If signallers reliably produce\nacoustically distinct vocalisations to different classes of predators,\nthen recipients often respond to them as if they have spotted the\ncorresponding predator themselves, presumably because they\ndraw inferences about ongoing external events from the calls\n[2]. Very little is known about the psychological processes that\nunderlie and drive call production, and hence the term\n‘functionally referential’ is sometimes used to describe such cases.\nIn contrast to human speech, such communication systems are not\nnecessarily based on signallers and recipients understanding each\nother’s intentions [3]. Instead, the default assumption is that\nprimates and other animals do not vocalise to actively inform each\nother, but information is transmitted as a by-product of signallers\nresponding to evolutionarily important events.\nSomewhat strikingly, there is relatively little evidence for\nreferential signalling from our closest living relatives, the apes.\nThis is particularly puzzling in the light of a substantial literature\non referential signalling in various monkey species, such as vervet\nmonkeys, Diana monkeys, Campbell’s monkeys, putty-nosed\nmonkeys, or white-faced capuchin monkeys [4–8]. Recently, it\nhas been suggested that captive chimpanzees produce functionally\nreferential calls in response to different types of foods, but it is not\nyet clear what features of the food the calls denote [9–10].\nGibbons (Hylobatidae), the South-East Asian forests’ smaller apes,\nare known for a most remarkable behaviour, their loud and\nconspicuous songs that transmit over long distances, often up to\none kilometre or more through dense forest vegetation [11].\nAlthough mostly monogamous, gibbons occasionally engage in\nextra-pair copulations and take-overs of residents by males or\nfemales have been documented [12–13]. In most gibbon species,\nthe mated pair normally sings in the morning in a coordinated\nfashion, the so-called duet song, most likely to communicate to\nneighbouring individuals [14–19]. Gibbons sometimes also produce songs in response to predators, but no systematic study has\never been conducted to investigate this phenomenon [20–21].\nTheir body mass is small compared to other members of the\nHominoidea, more comparable to that of a large monkey (5 to\n11 kg). This is likely to make them vulnerable to predation from\nlarge cats, snakes and birds of prey and, perhaps because of this,\ngibbons almost exclusively reside in the upper forest canopy [22–\n25]. We were interested to what extent white-handed gibbons of\nKhao Yai National Park, Thailand, produced songs in response to\npotential predators and whether these songs differed from songs\ngiven as part of the daily morning routine, the duets.\nMETHODS\nStudy site and subjects\nKhao Yai National Park is situated approximately 130 km NE of\nBangkok, Thailand (101u229E, 14u269N). Data were collected at\nthe Central Mo Singto study site, situated at an elevation of 730–\n860 m [26]. Habituation of groups started during the 1980ies. At\nthe time of the study, 13 groups were available for observations\nwith all group members individually known and social histories\ndocumented for most of them (Table 1).\nStudy groups consisted of between 2 to 6 individuals, mostly an\nadult pair and their offspring, sometimes with more than one adult\nAcademic Editor: Nathan Emery, University of Cambridge, United Kingdom\nReceived October 4, 2006; Accepted October 16, 2006; Published December 20,\n2006\nCopyright: ß 2006 Clarke et al.

Males and females disperse from their natal group\nat or some years after reaching sexual maturity, starting at about\n7–8 years of age. White-handed gibbons are sexually monomorphic, and of either light or dark pelage colour, although this is\nunrelated to sex or age. The Central Mo Singto study site borders\non the distribution area of the pileated gibbon (Hylobates pileatus),\nand a hybrid zone exists between the two species.\nVocal behaviour\n(a) Single notes: The basic vocal behaviour of white-handed\ngibbons has been described already [18] and, whenever possible,\nwe used the same terminology (fig. 1). Individual vocal units are\ntermed ‘notes’, of which seven different types can be distinguished:\n(1) ‘wa’, (2) ‘hoo’, (3) ‘leaning wa’, (4) ‘oo’, (5) ‘sharp wow’, (6)\n‘waoo’, and (7) ‘other’. The ‘hoo’ was originally considered part of\nthe ‘wa’ group, but we found that this class was consistently lowerpitched than ‘wa’ (mean frequency = 73.8 Hz636.9, n = 115), of\nlower amplitude, and usually covering a frequency range of less\nthan 100 Hz. These three parameters were perceptually salient\nand they allowed us to reliably discriminate between ‘wa’ and\n‘hoo’ notes.\n(b) Note combinations: Individual notes are rarely produced\nin isolation but are normally assembled into more complex\nstructures, so-called ‘figures’ or ‘phrases’, to form a ‘song’. Figure 2\ndepicts two prominent examples of phrases, the relatively rigid\n‘female great call’ and the ‘male reply’. If two group members\nproduce songs in a coordinated way, this is termed a ‘duet’.\nData collection and equipment\nThe study was undertaken between April 2004 and August 2005.\nAll calls were recorded using Sony DAT recorders (TCD-D8 and\nTCD-D7), and Sennheiser directional microphones (MKH815T\nand ME66) with windshields. Ad libitum recordings throughout the\nday resulted in a library of natural duet songs (n = 14) from\ndifferent groups, which we then compared with predator-induced\nsongs. Natural predator encounters are very difficult to observe in\ndense rainforest habitats and systematic studies are almost\nimpossible to conduct. Hence, we elicited songs by experimentally\npresenting realistic life-size predator models to the different study\ngroups.\nOur model predators were custom-made, to match photographs\nof the real predators, and positioned in their natural resting or\nhiding position [30] (see fig. 3). We tested the gibbons’ responses to\nthe following predator types: clouded leopard (Neofelis nebulosa),\ntiger (Panthera tigris), reticulated python (Python reticulates), and\ncrested serpent eagle (Spilornis cheela). For the tiger and clouded\nleopard models, we used two different exemplars. Clouded leopard\nmodels consisted of fake-fur wrapped around an object, such as\na large rucksack, positioned approximately 1 m from the ground\non a log or stone. Tiger models consisted of a person covered by\nfake-fur. The reticulated python model was made from several\ndraught excluders of approximately 10 cm in diameter, sewn\ntogether and painted, to make a tube of about 4 metres in length.\nThe python was placed, usually coiled, at about 1–2 metres above\nthe forest floor in a small tree, tree stump, or log. The crested\nserpent eagle model, finally, was made from chicken wire and\npapier-maˆche ́, painted and feathered with feather dusters bought\nlocally. It was hoisted 4–10 m into the trees with a rope, and\npositioned usually between two parallel branches as though\nperched on the lower branch. For this, we shot a weight attached\nto a fishing line over an appropriate branch with a catapult,\nallowing us to pull the rope over the branch for hosting and\npositioning the eagle model into the canopy.\nOur overall aim was to keep stress for the study animals as low\nas possible. Some of our observations suggested that natural\npredation events could occur at a maximum rate of about one per\n3–4 days. We decided to present predator models at intervals of no\nmore than one per week per group, considerably below the\nmaximum observed rate. Each group was exposed only once,\nmaximally twice, with a particular model type. Predator models\nwere presented in open forest habitat, so that individuals always\nhad open escape routes.\nExperimental protocol\nGroups were located usually by their morning duets, or by\nidentifying their sleeping site the night before. Once found, the\nobserver (EC) followed them for at least 2 hours before an\nexperimental trial was initiated. This period permitted the\nindividuals to habituate to the observer’s presence and it provided\nbaseline vocal and non-vocal data before model presentation. If no\nreal predator was encountered during this 2-hour period,\na predator model was positioned so that the subjects could not\nobserve the procedure. The model was then displayed for a period\nof about 20 minutes total, starting from when the gibbons had\ndetected it, and then removed. The observer usually remained\nwith the group for at least two more hours, or until the group\nreached their final sleeping site for the day. Throughout model\npresentation, the focal individuals’ behaviour was monitored\ncontinuously and recordings were made of their calls. The vocal\nresponses of neighbouring groups were also recorded whenever\nthey occurred.\nData analyses\nAs outlined, we were interested in the structural differences of\ngibbon songs produced (a) as part of their early morning routine\nand (b) in response to predators.

Gibbon song notes as distinguished by Raemaekers et al. [18]: (1) The ‘wa’ note is a short and steeply rising note, appearing as a more or\nless straight line on the spectrogram; sometimes appearing slightly concave. It consistently spans over 100 Hz in the frequency domain, which sets it\naside from the ‘hoo’ note. (2) The ‘hoo’ is a low frequency quiet note consistently spanning a much narrower frequency range than ‘wa’ notes. (3) The\n‘leaning wa’ notes may be more or less straight like the ‘wa’ notes but longer in duration, and therefore lean more to the right; sometimes they have\na slight bump in the middle. (4) The ‘oo’ note is of a relatively even pitch and therefore produces a flat note, as seen on the spectrogram, of varying\nduration. Sometimes it may rise slightly at the start. (5) The ‘sharp wow’ note is a loud and penetrating note. It rises steeply at first then falls steeply to\nproduce a concave curve. It invariably spans more than 700 Hz in the frequency domain. The end of the note may be prolonged horizontally. (6) The\n‘waoo’ note is highly variable. It always rises steeply at first, but then may hold pitch at an even level or fall in pitch to create a convex curve. It spans\na much lower frequency range than the ‘sharp wow’. (7) Notes that did not fit in with the shapes and definitions of the other six notes described\nabove were allocated as ‘other’. These were highly variable, and some may warrant their own unique note category, but for the purposes of this study\nthey are grouped together. This category also describes the above six note shapes when given with major pitch modulations that give them a wobbly\nor trembling quality. Finally, the ‘ooaa’ is extremely rare and was not found in any of the analysed recordings in this study, and so is not described\nhere.\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0000073.g001\nWild Gibbon Songs\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 3 December 2006 | Issue 1 | e73sampling efforts [31]. Nevertheless, groups responded strongly to\nthis predator model, in one case also triggering a vocal response\nfrom a neighbouring group.\nWhenever we recorded neighbour responses to the focal groups’\nsinging behaviour to a predator, we analysed these calls as well, as\nthis provided us with a natural experiment: Since we knew exactly\nwhat the focal group responded to, we could determine what\ninformation their songs potentially transmitted to recipients in\nadjacent home-ranges or to group members who were temporarily\naway from the group. We included the response to the tiger model\nfor this analysis due to the low sample size.\nCalls were digitised using Cool Edit 2000 software. Spectrograms were made using Raven 1.2.1 with a Hanning window\nfunction, 8.71 Hz filter bandwidth, 0.5 Hz frequency resolution\nand 15 s grid time resolution. Gibbons’ singing is a crescendo of\nnotes, particularly in response to predators. Vocal behaviour\nusually starts with a series of very soft ‘hoo’ notes, initially only\naudible at close range, but rapidly grading into much louder units\ncarrying over long distances. Hence, for each song we defined its\nstart as the first loud non-‘hoo’ note. Then, we determined the\nfollowing: (a) number of ‘hoo’ notes and (b) duration of ‘hoo’\nsequence before song onset. After song onset we determined (c)\npresence of and (d) latency to first ‘sharp wow’ note, (e) latency to\nfirst female great call and (f) latency to male reply, and (g) total\nduration of singing. We also conducted a sequential analysis to\ncompare the first 10 notes per song in the duet and predatory\ncontexts.\nThe identity of each gibbon’s voice was distinguishable to the\nexperimenter, and the order in which each group member called\nwas also noted at the time of predator presentation to facilitate\nanalyses. Statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS software,\nmainly non-parametric procedures such as Mann-Whitney U-tests\nand Fisher’s exact tests.\nRESULTS\nPredator-induced songs\nGibbons reliably sang in response to the terrestrial, but not the\nraptor, predator models: clouded leopard (8/8 trials), tiger (9/9\ntrials), reticulated python (3/9 trials), crested serpent eagle (0/7),\nsuggesting that singing is a firm part of these primates’ natural\ndefence to ground predators.\nSong composition: early differences\nAlthough there were no obvious acoustic differences between the\nsongs given in duet contexts and those given in response to\npredators, more detailed analyses revealed a number of subtle\ndifferences. As soon as an individual began to sing (by producing\nloud non-‘hoo’ notes) we compared the first 10 notes for each song\nbetween the two contexts, which is roughly equivalent to about\n15 s of singing (mean duration = 12.4669.13 s, n = 38). We were\nparticularly interested in this initial song segment because, if\ngibbons conveyed any information about external events, they\nshould do so as early as possible to benefit conspecific recipients,\nparticularly during predator encounters. Two main differences\nemerged. First, ‘leaning wa’ notes were significantly less likely to\noccur in the predatory than the duet context (Fisher’s exact test,\np,0.001). Second, there were significantly more ‘hoo’ notes\nnested within the other call units in the predatory than in the duet\ncontext (N duet = 18; N predatory = 20; U = 111.5; p,0.05; MannWhitney U-test, two-tailed). Figure 4 illustrates the patterns.\nSong composition: overall differences\nApart from the first 10 notes only, we found additional overall\ndifferences in song composition depending on context: ‘sharp\nwow’ notes were significantly more common in predatory than in\nduet songs (Fisher’s Exact test, p = 0.001), appearing on average\n236.46346.8 s into a predatory song (n = 11). We also found\n‘sharp wows’ in some duet songs (n = 6/14, mean latency =\n71.5647.2 s), but interestingly, they were all given by groups that\nhad not been fully habituated to human presence (groups D, J,\nand NOS; table 1). It is likely, therefore, that the ‘sharp wows’\nare notes given in response to any disturbance, which can be\nincorporated into regular duets and predator-induced songs.\nOverall, songs given in the predatory context were significantly\nlonger than songs in the duet context (mean duration = 2005.06\n1560.0 s, n = 11, versus 625.96450.7 s, n = 14, U = 28.0, p,0.01;\nMann-Whitney U-test, two-tailed). Predator-induced songs were\nalways introduced by a long series of soft ‘hoo’ notes. The number\nFigure 2. The female great call and male reply phrases. The female great call is a loud and penetrating two-humped call that is largely invariable\nwithin and between individuals, lasting on average 17.4 seconds (61.32, n = 13, duets and predator contexts). The male reply is similarly stereotyped\nand usually follows the female call swiftly (underlined portion).\ndoi:10.1371/journal.pone.0000073.g002\nWild Gibbon Songs\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 4 December 2006 | Issue 1 | e73of these notes differed significantly between the predatory and the\nduet contexts (predatory: 100.96110.9, n = 11; duet: 9.268.3,\nn = 14; U = 4.0, p,0.001 Mann-Whitney U-test; two-tailed).\nCorrespondingly, the total duration of the ‘hoo’ note series in\nthe predatory context was significantly longer than in the duet\ncontext (predatory: 158.76290.6 s, n = 11; duet: 9.8613.1 s,\nn = 14, U = 17, p = 0.001; Mann-Whitney U-test, two-tailed).\nFemale great calls\nThe female great call, finally, is a stereotyped sequence of notes\ndescribed as a phrase, lasting on average 17.4361.32 s (n = 13).\nFemales reliably produced great calls in both contexts, but during\nduets they were delivered significantly earlier compared to when\nresponding to predators (duets: 80.0635.2 s, n = 14; predatory:\n682.46669.8 s, n = 9; U = 2.0, p,0.001, Mann-Whitney U-test,\ntwo-tailed) with no overlap: Great calls during the first two\nminutes were reliably linked with the duet context, whereas great\ncalls given after this time period were always associated with the\npresence of a predator (Fisher’s exact test, p,0.001). Males usually\nreplied to female great calls with a specific phrase, but these replies\ncame significantly earlier in the predatory than in the duet context\n(predatory = 21.361.7 s, n = 9; duets: 1.063.4 s, n = 14;\nU = 23.0, p = 0.012, Mann-Whitney U-test, two-tailed).

During four\nother predator trials, a neighbouring group began to sing after the\ncommencement of the study group’s singing, allowing us to\nanalyse the structure of these calls with regards to two indicators of\npredator-induced songs: the presence of ‘sharp wows’ and the\ndelay of the female great call beyond 2 min. Our analyses showed\nthat all seven response songs contained ‘sharp wow’ notes\n(neighbouring groups: n = 4, absent group members: n = 3). In\naddition, in two of the four neighbouring groups, the first female\ngreat call was delayed beyond the critical 2 min threshold, further\ndemonstrating that these groups perceived and responded to the\nsongs of their neighbours with the correct and matching predator\nsongs.\nWe were also able to analyse a number of songs that were given\nin response to the regular duets by a neighbouring group (n = 4).\nAs predicted, in all cases the first female great call was delivered\nduring the first 2 min, indicating a normal duet context, and we\nnever recorded any ‘sharp wow’ notes. Table 2 summarises the\nmain results.\nDISCUSSION\nWe were interested in gibbon songs because, apart from human\nspeech, these vocalisations provide a remarkable case of acoustic\nsophistication and versatility in primate communication. Individuals combine a finite number of call units into structurally more\ncomplex sequences in rule-governed ways, hereby conveying\ndifferent contextual situations. Our field experiments revealed that\nwhite-handed gibbons of Khao Yai National Park, Thailand, were\nable to produce structurally different types of songs in the predator\nand duet contexts with the following differences.\nFirst, predator-induced songs were introduced by significantly\nmore ‘hoo’ notes than duet songs. Second, overall song duration\nwas longer in the predator context than in the duet context. Third,\nthe first female-specific great call was significantly delayed in\na predatory song, although the acoustic structure of this phrase did\nnot seem to differ between contexts. Fourth, males replied earlier\nto their own female’s great calls in predation context than in duets.\nThe absence of female great calls during the early part of a song,\nand hearing the male’s hurried reply, in other words, are reliable\nindicators that the callers are singing in response to a ground\npredator, although this information only becomes available after\na while. Fifth, predatory songs contained a smaller number of\n‘leaning wa’ notes and a higher number of ‘hoo’ notes, than duet\nsongs. The absence of ‘leaning was’ and presence of ‘hoos’ in the\ninitial parts of a song, in other words, could function as reliable\nearly indicators of a predator encounter. Finally, songs given to\npredators invariably contained ‘sharp wow’ notes, while duet songs\nusually did not. If ‘sharp wows’ were present in duets, then this was\nonly in groups that were not well habituated to human observers\n(D, J, NOS; see Table 1), suggesting that these duet songs encoded\nthe presence of a human observer. In all other aspects these songs\nwere identical to normal duet songs, for example, the female great\ncall appeared within the first 2 min and the male reply was\nnormal, and the songs were not introduced by a series of quiet\n‘hoo’ notes. We also observed that duet-based ‘sharp wows’ were\ngiven earlier in the song than the ones that were part of the\npredator songs, making this note a particularly interesting\ncandidate to convey environmental events and further illustrating\nthe remarkable flexibility underlying gibbon calling behaviour, not\nunlike those described for some passerine birds [32].\nGibbon songs are highly complex acoustic structures, and it may\nwell be possible that there were other important acoustic cues\npresent that we overlooked. For example, it appeared that male\nand female songs were more similar to each other in the predation\nthan in the duet context, providing further cues that could be\nperceptually salient to receivers. Whatever the perceptually\nrelevant cues, our observations also demonstrated that neighbouring groups were able to differentiate between songs given in the\ntwo contexts. In particular, we observed a predator-specific delay\nin the production of the first great call, as well as the inclusion of\n‘sharp wow’ notes in all cases in which neighbours responded to\nthe predator-induced song. We never observed these patterns in\nthe response songs of neighbours to normal duets. In all observed\ncases, absent males began to sing while returning to the rest of the\ngroup. Again, we never observed such behaviour during normal\nduets. The returning males’ songs always included ‘sharp wow’\nnotes, a convincing sign that they understood the meaning of the\nsong produced by their group.\nWhy do gibbons produce these loud and conspicuous songs in\nresponse to ground predators? One function of alarm calling is to\nalert kin to the presence of a predator [33]. The gibbons at Khao\nYai frequently change group compositions, and as a result close\nrelatives often live in neighbouring groups [13]. For example,\nmembers of groups A and B are closely related because the adult\nmale from B is a brother of the adult males and juvenile male from\nTable 2.

Kin selection, in other\nwords, could explain long-distance alarm calling in this and other\nspecies of gibbons [34]. In the case of large cats, empirical work\nhas shown that primate alarm calls have a direct deterring effect\non hunting behaviour [35], perhaps further explaining why it is\nadaptive to produce loud songs when hearing a neighbouring\ngroup singing to a predator. The quiet ‘hoo’ note series, which\nreliably precedes a predatory song, could function to alert\nimmediate group members to the location of the predator, and\nperhaps even to signal detection to a nearby predator. Another\ninteresting finding was that the gibbons did not produce songs to\nraptor models, although other types of alarm calls are produced to\nreal raptors and models, a topic of ongoing research.\nSexual selection has been proposed as the main evolutionary\nmechanism for the evolution of gibbon song: males and females\nproduce sexually dimorphic song bouts and songs are used in mate\nand home range defence, and in mate attraction [36]. In a recent\nreview on the role of sexual selection on primate vocal behaviour,\nSnowdon [37] noted that the primate literature was weak on\nevidence of how individual variation in vocal behaviour impacted\non reproductive decisions. In contrast, in many species of\nsongbirds, call complexity is linked with male-male competition\nand mate attraction [32]. The general finding is that better quality\nmales sing more or better than other males, usually leading to\nhigher reproductive success because this is attractive to females or\nbecause it increases the male’s ability to defend a territory.\nAlthough there is no comparable evidence for the gibbons,\na number of parallels are striking. The gibbons’ monogamous\nmating system is highly unusual, with some studies even reporting\nsexual polyandry [12,27–28,38–39]. Vocal behaviour appears to\nfunction as a powerful tool to deal with the immense sexual\ncompetition under which these primates operate, and it may not\nbe surprising that they have evolved unusually complex vocal skills\nto deal with these social challenges. Not unlike humans, gibbons\nassemble a finite number of call units into more complex structures\nto convey different messages, and our data show that distant\nindividuals are able to distinguish between different song types and\ninfer meaning. This study thus offers first evidence of a functionally\nreferential communication system in a free-ranging ape species,\nwhich is based on a simple phonological syntax [40].\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe are grateful to K.

Unlike the development of identification signals in most other\nspecies, signature whistle development is strongly influenced by\nvocal learning. This learning ability is maintained throughout life,\nand dolphins frequently copy each other’s whistles in the wild. It\nhas been hypothesized that signature whistles can be used as\nreferential signals among conspecifics, because captive bottlenose\ndolphins can be trained to use novel, learned signals to label\nobjects. For this labeling to occur, signature whistles would have\nto convey identity information independent of the caller’s voice\nfeatures. However, experimental proof for this hypothesis has\nbeen lacking. This study demonstrates that bottlenose dolphins\nextract identity information from signature whistles even after all\nvoice features have been removed from the signal. Thus, dolphins\nare the only animals other than humans that have been shown to\ntransmit identity information independent of the caller’s voice or\nlocation.\nanimal communication  individual recognition  Tursiops truncatus\nI\ndentity information is encoded in most animal calls, and can\ngive details of species, population, group, family line, and\u0001or\nindividual identity. Although most animals encode some identity\ninformation in their calls, comparatively few studies have demonstrated individual discrimination or even recognition. If it\noccurs, it is usually based on general voice features that affect all\ncall types produced by an individual and allow individual discrimination even if different animals produce the same call type\n(1–4). However, voice features are subtle and can be masked by\nbackground noise or lost over long transmission distances (5–7).\nSome species use specific cohesion calls in contexts of social\nseparation. There are two types of such calls. The most common\nscenario is the use of an isolation or cohesion call type that is\nshared among all members of a species. Here, the identity\ninformation is again encoded in individual voice features that\naffect selected features of the call without changing its overall\ngestalt. These calls are common in mobile species that live in\nhigh-background-noise environments where group cohesion depends on vocal recognition. Penguins, for example, display\ntremendous interindividual variation in their cohesion calls, but\nall individuals of a species use the same type of call to maintain\ncohesion (8). The other strategy to increase distinctiveness of\nidentity information is the use of an individually distinctive and\nunique call type by each individual. The assumption here is that\nthe identity information is encoded in the call type, i.e., the\npattern of frequency modulation over time that gives a spectrographic contour its distinctive shape, rather than in more subtle\nvoice features of the individual. This strategy appears to be less\ncommon in animals. Several bird species develop individually\nspecific elements or song types as part of their song displays, and\nthese can be used to identify individuals (9, 10). Humans develop\nnames to facilitate identification, and bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) are thought to have a similar system based on the\ntremendous amount of interindividual variability in their signature whistles (11, 12) but not in other whistle types (13–15).\nAlthough theoretically the transition from subtle variations\nwithin a call type to different call types is a continuous one, there\nis a noticeable distinction between species that use either end of\nthe spectrum. Developing individually distinctive call types\nappears to require vocal learning (9, 16–18), which may be one\nreason why such calls are rare in animals.\nObservations of individually distinctive call types suggest that\nthe identity information is encoded in the type difference rather\nthan in voice cues, but few studies have confirmed this hypothesis. Humans and dolphins (11, 19) copy individually distinctive\ncall types in vocal interactions, and at least humans are capable\nof using them as descriptive labels in referential communication.\nBottlenose dolphins can be taught to use artificial signals to refer\nto objects (20). If this is a skill used with signature whistles, it may\nbe a rare case of referential communication with learned signals\nin nonhumans. However, it is not known whether signature\nwhistle shape carries identity information. Sayigh et al. (21)\nconducted a playback study in which they demonstrated that\ndolphins recognize related conspecifics, but this discrimination\ncould have been based on voice features because original\nrecordings of whistles were used. In this study, we address the\nquestion of whether individual discrimination through signature\nwhistles is independent of such voice features, as it is in human\nnaming. To test this question, we produced synthetic whistles that\nhad the same frequency modulation but none of the voice\nfeatures of known signature whistles. We conducted playback\nexperiments to known individuals, testing their responses to\nsynthetic signature whistles that resembled those of familiar\nrelated and unrelated individuals. We hypothesized that, as in\nthe study of Sayigh et al. (21), animals would turn more often\ntoward the speaker if they heard a whistle resembling that of a\nrelated individual.\nResults\nIndividuals turned more toward the speaker if the playback was\na synthetic signature whistle of a close relative than a synthetic\nsignature whistle of a known unrelated individual matched for\nage and sex (Z \u0001 2.236, P \u0001 0.025) (see Figs. 1 and 2). This effect\nwas found for 9 of 14 animals. This result clearly demonstrates\nthat the whistle modulation contour carries identity information\nthat is used by receivers. Three animals showed no preference,\nand two turned more toward the stimulus that resembled an\nunrelated individual. We found no significant difference in head\nturns away from the speaker between the two different stimuli\nclasses (Z \u0001 0.267, P \u0001 0.789), nor were there any significant\ndifferences in whistle rates in response to playbacks (Z \u0001 0.84,\nP \u0001 0.401).

We did not find a significant difference\nbetween the similarities of the whistles of target animals to those\nof related and unrelated individuals (Z \u0001 1.352, P \u0001 0.176). We\nalso tested whether target individuals responded more strongly\nto those stimuli that were significantly more or less similar to\ntheir own whistle, independent of kin relationship, and again\nfound no significant difference (Z \u0001 1.406, P \u0001 0.16). Thus, our\nresults demonstrate individual rather than kin discrimination,\nbased on the frequency modulation pattern of whistles.\nDiscussion\nThis study demonstrates individual identity information being\nencoded independent of the signaler’s voice or location in the\nnatural communication system of a nonhuman animal. We found\nnot only that the frequency modulation pattern of signature\nwhistles carries sufficient information for individual discrimination but that this information is used by the receiver to identify\nindividuals. This finding does not mean that dolphins do not have\nindividually specific voice features. However, sound production\nis greatly affected by changing water pressure (22), which would\nmake voice recognition underwater more difficult than in air.\nBottlenose dolphins live in a three-dimensional environment\nwith few landmarks or other visual cues that could aid group\ncohesion (23). In such conditions, signature whistles can facilitate continued contact between individuals. This is reflected in\nthe fact that 50% of bottlenose dolphin whistles produced in\nthe wild are signature whistles (24). Although variation is not\nunexpected in a biological system, we investigated why some\nindividuals did not react in the expected way by either showing\nno difference in reactions (three animals) or turning more\ntoward the nonrelated individual (two animals). However, there\nwas no pattern in our data that provided an explanation. We\nsuspect that this is a motivational issue that may have to do with\nthe exact nature of the relationship between our target animals\nand the animals that we used to create the test stimuli. Sayigh et\nal. (21) found similar individual variability in responses to\nplaybacks of natural signature whistles.\nOur results also suggest that animals recognize each other’s\nwhistles individually rather than just discriminate between them.\nWe define recognition as perceiving something to be identical\nwith something previously known. Discrimination can use but\ndoes not require such previous knowledge if it is solely based on\nthe comparison of distinctive features. The animals clearly\ndiscriminated between stimuli because they showed a preference\nfor one class of stimuli. The question then is why they would\ndevelop such a preference. We see two possible explanations for\nsuch a preference. One is a bias toward kin based on a preference\nfor an underlying feature in the modulation pattern used by\nrelated individuals. However, we did not find any evidence for a\nsystematic bias in the stimuli that resembled those of a particular\nkin group. The other explanation, which our results strongly\nsupport, is that the animals recognized the preferred stimulus\nindividually as one they had encountered before. This finding\nshould clarify previous confusion around the role or even\nexistence of signature whistles (14, 25, 26). The fact that individuals clearly react to identity information in synthetic signature\nwhistles that had all voice information removed demonstrates\nthat the contour carries such signature information and that this\ninformation is used by the receiver.\nJanik and Slater (27) argued that the need for individual\nrecognition and group cohesion was the most likely selection\npressure for the evolution of vocal learning in dolphins. Vocal\nlearning allows increasing interindividual variability of signature\nwhistles while maintaining potential group, population, or species features in the signal. In signature whistle development, an\ninfant appears to copy a whistle that it only heard rarely and then\nuses a slightly modified version as its own signature whistle\n(16–18). This process leads to individually distinctive signature\nwhistles but also may lead to geographic variation in whistle\nparameters over longer distances (28). Currently, we do not\nknow to what extent bottlenose dolphins may use this group or\ncommunity information, if present. It is known, however, that\nthe largest dolphin species, the killer whale (Orcinus orca), uses\ngroup-specific dialects in its communication system (29). An\ninvestigation of more species will help to clarify the role of vocal\nlearning in the development of dolphin signals.\nAlthough vocal learning may have evolved in one particular\ncontext, it can be used for other purposes once it is established.\nFor example, learning also allows copying of signals in direct\nsocial interactions. Dolphins frequently copy each other’s whistles in the wild (30). The fact that signature whistle shape carries\nidentity information independent from voice features presents\nthe possibility to use these whistles as referential signals, either\naddressing individuals or referring to them, similar to the use of\nnames in humans. Given the cognitive abilities of bottlenose\ndolphins (31), their vocal learning and copying skills (32), and\ntheir fission–fusion social structure (33), this possibility is an\nintriguing one that demands further investigation.\nMaterials and Methods\nOur study was conducted on the bottlenose dolphin community\nof Sarasota Bay, FL (34). Capture–release projects of the\ndolphins in this community since 1975 have provided us with\nrecordings of signature whistles for most individuals (35). To\ncapture animals, a net was deployed from a small outboard vessel\nin water of 3-m depth. This net was 500 \u0004 4 m in size. Once\ndeployed, it created a net corral that was used to keep the\nanimals for short (1–2 h) periods of time after which they were\nreleased back into the wild. Since 1984, recordings were made by\nusing suction cup hydrophones on the melon of the animals while\nthey were being held in the net corral or examined out of the\nwater.\nSayigh et al. (21) demonstrated that bottlenose dolphins from\nSarasota can recognize signature whistles of individuals by\nplaying back original whistles to dolphins and analyzing their\nturning responses. However, their study did not determine\nwhether this recognition was through voice features or the\ndistinctive frequency modulation pattern that signature whistles\nare known for and that can be copied by other individuals. We\nused the same paradigm as Sayigh et al. (21) but played synthetic\nwhistles instead of natural dolphin whistles. We used SIGNAL 3.1\n(Engineering Design, Berkeley, CA) to synthesize whistles; a\nbrief description of this process follows. Every tonal sound can\nbe represented by a frequency function F(t) and an amplitude\nFig. 2. Turning responses toward the kin and nonkin synthetic whistle\nstimuli. Data for the same individual are connected by lines.\nJanik et al.

We produced synthetic signature whistles by\ntracing F(t), the frequency modulation pattern of the fundamental frequency, of each available bottlenose dolphin signature\nwhistle in the Sarasota dolphin community (13) and then\nsynthesizing tonal signals by using F(t) and an average whistle\namplitude envelope A(t)average, which represented the sound’s\ntime-varying intensity (36). In each synthesis process F(t) was\nused from the individual signature whistle that we wanted to\nproduce. A(t)average was the same for all synthesized whistles. This\naverage amplitude function A(t)average was produced from 20\nsignature and 20 nonsignature whistle A(t) values, which were\nfirst all warped to the same length and then added together to\ncreate an average whistle. We then calculated A(t)average using\nthe SIGNAL 3.1 ENV command using a 5-msec decay time. This\ncommand computed A(t)average by detecting the time-varying\namplitude envelope of the whistle. First, it rectified the time\nwaveform, then it traced the rectified waveform by following it\nwhen it increased and exponentially decaying when it decreased.\nThe exponential time constant was set at 5 msec. Thus, a decrease\nwas either followed closely, or the envelope decayed exponentially\nif the decrease was too rapid. A(t)average then was smoothed by using\na 2-msec rectangular averaging window to avoid added noise during\nthe synthesis process. Some individuals produced multiloop whistles, in which the same contour pattern was produced at least twice\nwhenever the dolphin used the whistle. Each repetition is referred\nto as a ‘‘loop,’’ and such repeated whistles were considered to be one\nunit. Multiloop whistles were synthesized by using all of our\nstandardized A(t)average for each loop of the whistle (Fig. 1). Our\nwhistle synthesis provided us with 121 synthetic signature whistles\nthat all shared the same waveform envelope A(t)average and only\ndiffered in their frequency modulation patterns. We used a subset\nof these stimuli in playbacks to 14 temporarily captured adult\nanimals (7 male and 7 female).\nPlaybacks were conducted during four capture seasons\nbetween June 2002 and February 2005. We used a LL9162\nspeaker (Lubell Labs, Columbus, OH) connected to a car\npower amplifier to project sounds to dolphins. Sound files were\nplayed either from a laptop computer or a SL-S125 CD player\n(Panasonic, Secaucus, NJ). The frequency response for the\ncombined system was 240 Hz to 20 kHz \u0005 3 dB. All stimulus\npairs were played at the same source level, generating a\nreceived level at 2-m distance from the speaker (the location\nof our experimental animal) that approximated the received\nlevel of whistles produced by a nearby dolphin (as judged by\nthe experimenters). Playbacks were monitored with a SSQ94\nhydrophone (High Tech, Inc., Gulfport, MI) next to the\nspeaker. Whistle rates were recorded by a custom-built suction\ncup hydrophone that was attached to the melon of the target\ndolphin. If there were other animals in the water during a\nplayback (five cases), their whistles also were recorded with a\nsuction cup hydrophone. All recordings were made with a\nPanasonic AG-7400 video recorder. The frequency response\nof the recording equipment was 50 Hz to 20 kHz \u0005 3 dB.\nPlayback sessions were recorded on a Sony DCRTRN 320\ndigital video camera from an overhead platform on a boat 2\nm above the water surface at the speaker position (see figure\n1 in ref. 21).\nEach animal was held in the net corral by several people with its\nhead free to move from side to side for at least 15 min before it was\nused for a playback. It was then moved into position next to the boat\nand the speaker and was held there for another 2-min pretrial phase\nbefore the playbacks started. In the setup the speaker was facing the\ndolphin and was placed 2 m to one side of the target animal. The\nboat was anchored in shallow areas and always faced into the\ncurrent. There always was open water behind the speaker. We\nrecorded all background noise continuously and aborted the playback if there was loud boat noise or if other dolphins were heard or\nseen in the area outside the net corral. Animals that were in aborted\ntrials were not used again in this experiment. All people holding the\nanimal were blind to the playback sequence and had no prior\nexperience with the whistles of this dolphin community (even\nthough the stimulus was only rarely audible in air). In three cases\nthere were two other animals held in the net corral at the time of\nthe experiment, and in two cases there was one other animal held\nin the water. In all but one of these cases the other animals were\npositioned behind the experimental animal so that it could not see\ntheir reactions. In one case the dependent calf of an experimental\nanimal was held to her right, while the speaker was on her left. This\nfemale turned toward both stimuli (i.e., away from the calf) and\nmore so in response to the stimulus resembling a related individual.\nEach animal listened to a sequence of synthetic whistles resembling the signature whistle of a related individual (as determined\nthrough long-term observations and confirmed through genetic\ntesting) and a sequence of synthetic whistles resembling that of an\nunrelated but known individual that was not directly related to the\ntarget individual but had been seen with it in the past 3 years.\nDepending on stimulus availability, kin whistles that were played\nback were either of mothers (if target animals were independent\noffspring) or independent offspring (if target animals were mothers). Unrelated individuals whose synthetic signature whistles were\nplayed were of the same sex and approximate age as the related\nindividual. Simple ratio coefficients of association (CoAs) (37)\ncalculated from photoidentification sighting data were used to\nensure that the target animal had spent at least some time with both\nindividuals in the previous three years, and CoAs between the\ntarget animal and each stimulus animal for this time period were\nmatched as closely as possible. Each playback consisted of several\nrepetitions of the stimulus, and lasted for 30 sec. Playbacks were\nseparated by a quiet period of 5 min. Playback stimuli were\npresented in a balanced experimental design with seven trials in\nwhich the kin stimulus was played first and seven trials with the\nnonkin stimulus as the first playback. We also balanced the number\nof whistles played and the total duration of sound played in each\n30-sec playback, so that there was no bias in playbacks of kin or\nnonkin stimuli (see below). Following the methods of Sayigh et al.\n(1999), we counted head turns \u000620° toward or away from the\nplayback speaker within a 5-min period from the start of the\nplayback as a response. Anything 20° was not counted because\nanimals frequently moved back and forth within this range. We also\nrecorded whistle rates of the target animals. All analyses including\nthe scoring of reactions were conducted blindly to the stimulus from\nvideo recordings of the playback sessions. All data were tested by\nusing Wilcoxon signed ranks tests.\nBecause dolphin whistles vary in duration and loop number, it\nis difficult to balance a playback in which whistles of different\nindividuals are being used. Whistles were played back with\nalternating interwhistle intervals of 4 and 1 sec. We did not play\nany whistles outside of our 30-sec playback window. Depending\non the length of the whistle, this technique resulted in 4–9\nwhistles being played back in each 30-sec playback interval.\nStimulus whistles had between 1 and 4 loops, and the total\nduration of sound played varied from 2.9 to 11.2 sec. However,\nthere was no bias in whistle number (Z \u0001 0.368, P \u0001 0.713), loop\nnumber (Z \u0001 0, P \u0001 1), or total sound duration (Z \u0001 0.596, P \u0001\n0.551) for kin or nonkin whistles.\nWe thank all of the Earthwatch Institute and other volunteers who helped\nwith various aspects of the experiments over the years.

Here we\nshow that free-ranging putty-nosed monkeys\ncombine two vocalizations into different call\nsequences that are linked to specific external\nevents, such as the presence of a predator and\nthe imminent movement of the group. Our\nfindings indicate that non-human primates\ncan combine calls into higher-order sequences\nthat have a particular meaning.\nLike most forest guenons, male putty-nosed\nmonkeys (Cercopithecus nictitans) produce\ntwo acoustically distinct loud calls (‘pyows’\nand ‘hacks’) in response to a range of disturbances2,3. Males also call spontaneously, especially during morning foraging and evening\ntravel to sleeping sites. In addition, these calls\ncan function as alarm calls to warn the group\nof an approaching predator and to discourage\nattack3–5: pyows are used primarily when a\nleopard (Panthera pardus) is in the vicinity,\nand hacks are produced mainly in response to\ncrowned eagles (Stephanoaetus coronatus)\n(audio files are in supplementary information).\nApart from these predator-specific call\nsequences, we found that males regularly combine the same two calls into a third structure, a\n‘pyow–hack’ (or P–H) sequence, which usually\nconsists of one, two or three pyows followed\nby up to four hacks (total mean duration\n6.11\u00013.02 s). These P–H sequences were\nemitted in response both to eagles and to leopards, and were either isolated or interspersed\nwith other sequence types. We noticed that the\ngroup of monkeys would begin to move soon\nafter hearing a P–H sequence.\nTo test whether the function of the P–H call\nsequence could be to instigate this movement,\nwe carried out a field experiment in which leopard growls were played to 17 different monkey\ngroups, each consisting of several adult females\nwith their offspring and a single adult male, to\nelicit calling from the adult male (for details of\nmethods, see supplementary information). In\nnine groups (52.9%), the male produced call\nseries containing at least one P–H sequence; in\nthe other eight groups, the males also called, but\nno P–H sequences were produced.\nTwenty minutes later, we played a second\nstimulus, a series of hacks from the same position to imitate the alarm call produced by monkeys in the presence of a crowned eagle. This\nreliably elicited further vocal responses from all\n17 males, which enabled us to relocate the\ngroups precisely. Although putty-nosed monkeys sometimes move through the canopy to\nescape from an approaching leopard, this strategy is avoided when threatened by large raptors\nas it would increase the risk of attack: consequently, warning hacks on their own do not\ntrigger any movement of the group (Fig. 1).\nUsing a global positioning satellite unit (see\nmethods in supplementary information), we\nfound that the groups whose males had produced P–H sequences in response to growls had\ntravelled significantly farther than other groups\n(Fig. 1a; call series containing at least one P–H\nsequence: median 85 m; all other series: median\n17 m; two-tailed Mann-Whitney U-test, n19,\nn28, Z3.27, P0.0003).\nThe monkeys’ response to P–H sequences\nwas not confined to the predator context, but\nwas generally related to whether the group\nmoved. We recorded a total of 72 natural call\nsequences (that is, not experimentally induced)\nover two months from the single male of a\ngroup habituated to human observers and\nmonitored the group’s travelling patterns. A\nlarge proportion of the calls contained P–H\nsequences (40.3%) and elicited movement of\nthe group over significantly greater distances\nthan after P–H-free call series (Fig. 1b; for\nseries containing at least one P–H sequence:\nmedian 110 m; all other series: median 30 m;\nno calls: median 14 m; Kruskall–Wallis analysis of variance, n129, n243, n365, d.f.2,\n\u00042\n19.27, P0.00007; P–H vs other:\nZ–3.42, P0.0005; P–H vs none: Z–4.23,\nP0.0001; other vs none: Z–1.01, P0.314;\ntwo-tailed Mann-Whitney U-tests, Bonferroni\ncorrections for multiple comparisons).\nMost animals have a restricted repertoire of\ncalls, with innate and structurally fixed vocalizations. Combining existing calls into meaningful sequences increases the variety of\nmessages that can be generated6–10. The simple\nsystem used by putty-nosed monkeys encodes\nthe presence of different types of danger and\ntriggers group movement with just two basic\ncall types.\nKate Arnold, Klaus Zuberbühler\nSchool of Psychology, University of St Andrews,\nSt Andrews KY16 9JP, UK\ne-mail: kz3@st-and.ac.uk\n1.

Nearby listeners often behave as if the calls are meaningful to them, indicating that the calls may function as\nreferential labels for particular foods. We investigated whether rough grunt variants are the result of callers\nresponding to specific food types or relative food preferences. We recorded calls from captive individuals in\nresponse to nine different food items, which could be ranked as high, medium or low preference. Individuals consistently produced three acoustically distinct grunt variants to the three food preference classes.\nThere was no evidence that chimpanzees produced individual labels for food types of low and medium\npreference. However, calls to high-preference food types differed significantly in their acoustic structure.\nThese acoustic patterns remained stable over trials, suggesting that rough grunts have the potential to\nserve as semantic labels for individual high-preference food types. We were unable to replicate these findings with a set of recordings from the wild, although most other aspects of calling behaviour remained\nidentical. We discuss these discrepancies between the wild and captivity and suggest that the emergence\nof referential labels for food items may be a by-product of the special circumstances found in captive\nsettings.\nÓ 2006 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.\nVarious bird and primate species produce acoustic signals\nwhen encountering food. These signals typically attract\nothers to the feeding site, suggesting that callers must\nbenefit in some way from their seemingly altruistic behaviour. It has been suggested that callers profit from the\nresulting increase in group size, if it reduces the costs of\nvigilance (Elgar 1986), it increases foraging efficiency\n(Brown et al. 1991), or it defends the food source from competing species (Bugynar et al. 2001). Finally, callers may\nbenefit from attracting and helping relevant conspecifics,\nsuch as genetic relatives or potential mates (Trivers 1972).\nFood-associated calls are also interesting from a comparative psychology perspective, as they sometimes provide\na window into the mental processes underlying call\nproduction. In domestic chickens, Gallus gallus domesticus,\nfor example, males produce food-associated calls, and calling is mediated by the nature and composition of the\naudience (Marler et al. 1986a, b; Gyger & Marler 1988;\nEvans & Marler 1994). These calls elicit anticipatory feeding behaviour in recipients, suggesting that the calls are\nmeaningful to them in the sense that they predict the\npresence of food (Evans & Evans 1999).\nFood-associated calls are also documented in nonhuman\nprimates, and the underlying cognitive processes have\nbeen explored in some detail (e.g. Toque macaque,\nMacaca sinica: Dittus 1984; spider monkey, Ateles\ngeoffroyi: Chapman & Lefebvre 1990; tufted capuchin,\nCebus apella: Di Bitetti 2005; white-faced capuchin, Cebus\ncapucinus: Boinski & Campbell 1996; Gros-Louis 2003),\nalthough little is known about the kind of information\nconveyed by these calls. In domestic chickens, males are\nable to adjust their calling rate as a function of the quality\nof a food source, perhaps the result of different levels of\narousal. This may provide useful information for recipients, which goes beyond merely signalling the presence\nof food (Marler et al. 1986b; Gyger & Marler 1988). A\nnumber of New World monkeys appear to follow the\nsame principle: cottontop tamarins, Saguinus oedipus, and\nwhite-faced capuchins increase call rates to food they prefer, independent of quantity (Elowson et al. 1991; Roush &\nCorrespondence: K. Zuberbu ̈hler, School of Psychology, University of\nSt Andrews, St Andrews, Fife KY16 9JP, U.K. (email: kz3@st-andrews.\nac.uk).\n989\n0003e 3472/06/$30.00/0 Ó 2006 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

In rhesus macaques,\nMacaca mulatta, however, the calling rate is not related to\nfood preference but apparently varies with hunger level\n(Hauser & Marler 1993a, b). Instead, differences in preference are reflected in changes in the acoustic structure of\nthe calls (Hauser & Marler 1993a) and listeners appear\nable to gain information about the quality of the discovered food source from these calls (Hauser 1998).\nChimpanzees, Pan troglodytes, also vocalize when eating\nor approaching food (Goodall 1965, 1968, 1986; Reynolds\n1965). Others sometimes orient towards or approach the\ncalling animal (Goodall 1968, 1986), suggesting that\nthey extract some information from the calls. Acoustically,\nthese food-associated calls grade from soft grunts to highpitched shrieks, typically described under the umbrella\nterm ‘rough grunts’ (Marler & Tenaza 1977, page 987).\nThe mechanisms underlying call production are not\nwell described and the reasons why chimpanzees produce\nthese calls remain uncertain. However, we do know that\ncaptive chimpanzees are more likely to give rough grunts\nwhen discovering a large and divisible food source compared to a small or indivisible one (Hauser et al. 1993) and\nthat callers may adjust call production depending on the\naudience present (P. troglodytes: Hauser & Wrangham\n1987; P. paniscus: Van Krunkelsven et al. 1996).\nThere is some controversy concerning the nature of the\ninformation encoded by chimpanzee rough grunts. One\nstudy suggested that individuals produce acoustically\ndistinct rough grunt variants to different food types and\nthat these signals served as referential labels for recipients\n(Hallberg et al. 2003). In another study, individuals were allowed to search for either apples or bread at two different\nlocations, after a playback of a group member’s rough\ngrunts given to either apples or bread. The focal animal’s\nforaging behaviour was guided by the type of grunts played\nback, demonstrating that rough grunt variants informed\nrecipients about the nature of a food source encountered\nby the caller (Slocombe & Zuberbu ̈hler 2005). Both studies\nare consistent with the idea that chimpanzee rough grunts\ninform recipients about the type of food encountered by\nthe caller. If chimpanzees were labelling specific food\ntypes, then this would represent a rather sophisticated\ntype of functionally referential communication, requiring\nsubstantial degrees of social learning by both the signaller\nand recipient. Alternatively, a more parsimonious hypothesis suggests that the results of these previous studies can\nalso be explained by calls reflecting an individual’s assessment of the relative preference of the food encountered.\nTo test the two hypotheses, we examined data collected\nfrom a captive group of chimpanzees housed at Edinburgh\nZoo, U.K., and from wild chimpanzees of the Sonso community in Budongo Forest, Uganda.\nMETHODS\nStudy Sites\nEdinburgh\nK.S. collected data for 4 months between May and\nSeptember 2004 from a captive group of chimpanzees\nhoused at Edinburgh Zoo, U.K. The group consisted of\nthree adult, one subadult and two juvenile males and four\nadult and one subadult females, 5e43 years old, and was\nhoused in an outdoor area (1452 m 2 ) connected by a tunnel to a 90-m 2 indoor area. All individuals had free access\nto both areas through the tunnel at all times except during\ncleaning. They were fed up to eight times each day at irregular intervals. The chimpanzees were regularly fed over 20\ndifferent types of food and they received the nine foods\nused in this study at least twice a week in routine feeds\nduring the study period. Data were collected during feeding events in the outdoor enclosure, when food was\nscattered over the enclosure by a caretaker.\nBudongo\nK.S. collected data for a total of 6 months, during the\ndry seasons (JanuaryeMarch) of 2003 and 2004 from the\nSonso community of the Budongo Forest Reserve, Uganda\n(Reynolds 1992, 2005). Budongo Forest covers an area of\n428 km 2 of moist, semideciduous tropical forest, between\n1\u000e350 and 1\u000e550N and between 31\u000e080 and 31\u000e420E (Eggeling 1947). The study site is at an altitude of 1100 m and\nhas an annual rainfall of about 1600 mm. Habituation to\nhumans started in 1990. Provisioning has never been\nused. At the time of the study, the Sonso community consisted of 53 individuals with nine adult males and 17 adult\nfemales, four subadult males and two subadult females,\nand 21 juveniles and infants.\nData Collection\nFood preference hierarchy\nEdinburgh. To determine the food preferences of the\ncaptive study animals, we systematically tested nine food\ntypes (bread, banana, mango, grape, plum, chow, apple,\ngreens and carrot) in pairwise comparisons. During these\nevents, a caretaker scattered two types of foods in roughly\nequal amounts throughout the outdoor enclosure. The\nfeeding events were filmed and the first choice of each\nindividual was recorded. The chimpanzees were habituated to the presence of the observer and the video camera\nbefore data collection began. We recorded the choices of\nfour individuals (Louis, Quafzeh, Emma, Kilimi) from\na total of 55 feeding events (NLouis ¼ 52; NQuafzeh ¼ 49;\nNEmma ¼ 43; NKilimi ¼ 46). For each individual, we determined a food preference hierarchy based on his or her\nchoices, by counting how many times a particular food\nitem was chosen relative to the other eight food types.\nThese scores were then converted to percentages, ranging\nfrom 100% (i.e. always chosen above all other eight foods)\nto 0% (i.e. never chosen in comparison to the other eight\nfoods). The foods were then ranked for each individual on\nthe basis of the percentage scores.\nBudongo. We identified the three most highly preferred\nfood items during the dry season study period, based on\nthe proportions of the chimpanzees’ feeding time spent\nconsuming these items: 30.9% Cynometra alexandri (CYN),\n24.3% Ficus exasperata (Fe), 15.6% Ficus sur (FSu) (data\nfrom Bates 2005). It was not possible to determine food\nANIMAL BEHAVIOUR, 72, 5990preferences objectively in the wild population, in a comparable way to the captive population. However, based on\nthe feeding time data we were confident that the three\nfoods chosen could be ranked as mediumehighly preferred foods. We recorded the rough grunts produced by\nfour adult males in response to these three foods.\nRecording Rough Grunts\nFor the Edinburgh chimpanzees, rough grunts were\nrecorded from individuals feeding exclusively on one\ntype of food in the outdoor enclosure. Vocalizations\nwere recorded from a range of 5e20 m. For the Budongo\nchimpanzees, K.S. tried to follow a focal individual all\nday to record rough grunts while the individual was feeding from the three selected species. Recording distances\nvaried from 5 to 30 m. All recordings were made with\na Sennheiser directional microphone (wild: ME67/K6; captive: MKH816) and a Sony TCD-D8 portable DAT recorder.\nRecordings were transferred digitally from the DAT\nrecorder on to a PC (Toshiba, Celeron 1.8 GHz) with a sampling rate of 44.1 kHz, 16 bits accuracy using Cool Edit Pro\nLE (Syntrillium software Corporation, Phoenix, AZ,\nU.S.A.).\nSelection of Calls for Analysis\nEdinburgh\nWe excluded all calling bouts that suffered from heavy\ninterference, from either other chimpanzee calls or extraneous background noise such as other zoo animals or\nvisitors. This resulted in a set of 76 calling bouts, which\nwere suitable for acoustic analysis (range 1e3 bouts/\nindividual per food type). We selected the first 15 s of\neach bout starting from when the focal chimpanzee first\nmade physical contact with the food. Within these segments, we selected the first three calls that were free\nfrom other chimpanzee calls or masking noise. We analysed calls from four chimpanzees, one from each of four\nageesex classes (Louis, adult male; Emma, adult female;\nQuafzeh, subadult male; Kilimi, subadult female).\nBudongo\nWe recorded calls from four adult males (Black, Maani,\nNick and Zefa). As with the captive individuals, we\nselected the first 15 s of a calling bout once the chimpanzee was collecting food or feeding. We then measured the\nfirst three calls per bout that were free from other chimpanzee calls and other masking noise. This resulted in a total of 38 bouts from the four males (range 1e6 bouts/\nindividual per tree species).\nAcoustic Analyses\nFor acoustic analyses, we used Praat Version 4.2.23\n(www.praat.org) with the following settings: window\nlength: 0.005 s; dynamic range: 70 dB. Rough grunts consisted of both voiced and unvoiced calls. For unvoiced calls,\nit was impossible to determine the fundamental frequency,\nso we excluded from further analyses all measures related to\nthis otherwise commonly used parameter. The following\nfour measures could be reliably taken from all calls: (1) temporal parameters: duration of call (s): duration from beginning to end of main acoustic energy; intercall duration (s):\ntime from the end of the measured call to the beginning\nof the next call in the call sequence; (2) spectral parameters:\npeak frequency (Hz): frequency at which most acoustic energy was present in the call; first formant frequency (F1)\n(Hz): mean frequency of the first formant across the call\nfor which the first formant was present (M.J. Owren, unpublished software). There is an important difference between\nthese two spectral measurements. In primates and other\nmammals, the larynx is the main acoustic production device from where sound passes through the supralaryngeal\nvocal tract. Depending on its constrictions, the vocal tract\nhas differing resonant modes that selectively allow specific\nfrequencies to pass and radiate through the mouth or nostrils into the environment. These vocal tract resonances\nhave been termed ’formants’ (Fant 1960). While ‘peak frequency’ simply refers to the overall location of acoustic energy in the signal, ‘formant frequency’ refers specifically to\nthe filtering properties of the vocal tract only. Unequivocal\nidentification of formants requires an analysis technique\nthat separates the effect of the glottal source from the effect\nof the vocal tract (Owren & Bernacki 1998).\nStatistical Analyses\nCall structure and food preferences\nTo establish whether there was any relation between the\nacoustic structure of the rough grunts and individual food\npreferences, we analysed a sample of 108 calls from\ncaptive animals (4 individuals \u0003 3 preference categories \u0003 3 bouts \u0003 3 calls). Each individual contributed an\nequal number of bouts from each quality category, but\nthe food types within those categories were chosen randomly. We then ran an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA)\non the 108 calls with peak frequency, call rate, duration\nand first formant frequency entered as covariates and individual entered as a fixed factor. These independent\nvariables were used to predict the percentage preference\nrating of the food that elicited the calls.\nCall structure and food types\nTo examine whether call structure varied systematically\nwith food type, we investigated whether chimpanzees were\nable to encode information about particular food types\nwithin each preference category. We analysed high-,\nmedium- and low-preference food types separately in this\nway, to minimize the confounding effects of preference.\nFirst, rough grunts given to the highly preferred foods,\nbread, mango and banana, were analysed to investigate\nwhether calls varied reliably with type of food. Each of the\nfour captive individuals contributed one bout (containing\nthree calls) to each food type. Thus a total of 36 calls were\nanalysed, with each food type represented by 12 calls. For\nthe rough grunts given to the medium-preferred foods,\ngrapes, plums and chow, each of the four individuals\ncontributed one bout (containing three calls) to each food\nSLOCOMBE & ZUBERBU ̈ HLER: FOOD-ASSOCIATED CALLS 991type. Two exceptions to this were the calling bouts given to\nplums by Kilimi and Quafzeh, which contained only two\nmeasurable calls each. Thus a total of 34 calls were analysed,\nwith grapes and chow represented by 12 calls each and\nplums represented by ten calls. Finally, we analysed rough\ngrunts given to the least preferred foods, apples, greens and\ncarrots. The two female chimpanzees were never observed\ngiving rough grunts to greens or carrots; therefore, this\nanalysis was based only upon the data from the two males. A\ntotal of 18 calls were analysed, with each food type\nrepresented by six calls. If an individual had more than\none suitable calling bout for each food type, we randomly\nselected the bout to be used (range 1e3).\nWe conducted mixed-design analyses of variance\n(ANOVA) to investigate whether the four acoustic variables varied reliably with the type of food that elicited the\ncalls. The type of food was entered as the within-subjects\nvariable (three conditions) and individual was entered as\nthe between-subjects variable. We then conducted direct\ndiscriminant function analyses to assess how well the four\nacoustic variables, when taken together (providing a quantitative description of the sound), could discriminate\nbetween the food types associated with the call.\nTo obtain a more representative view of the larger\navailable data set, we generated three randomly chosen\ndata sets for each food type analysis. This allowed us to\nrun three iterations for each food type analysis, thereby\nusing a wider selection of randomly chosen calls than\na single iteration permitted.\nThe data sets used in the food type analyses were smaller\nthan those used in the first food preference analysis and\nwere therefore associated with lower levels of statistical\npower. To provide a fair and direct comparison of the two\ncompeting hypotheses, matching food preference data\nsets were produced for each of the nine food type analyses\n(3 \u0003 3 iterations). These data sets contained the same\nnumber of calls from each individual as each of the\n‘type’ analyses. This meant that the statistical tests carried\nout to test each hypothesis had identical levels of statistical power. The calls in each of the matching ‘preference’\ndata sets were randomly selected in the same way as\nreported for the first preference analysis.\nRESULTS\nFood Preference Hierarchy\nFor the Edinburgh chimpanzees, we tested preferences to\nall nine foods in all possible combinations, i.e. 36 pairwise\ncomparisons. Some pairings were tested multiple times.\nThere was high consistency in individual choices over\ntime, suggesting that individual preferences were stable.\nThe four study animals showed a high degree of agreement\non preference, with differences appearing between individuals only for the high-preference foods (Table 1). On\nthe basis of the mean group ratings, these nine food items\nwere divided into three broad group preference categories:\nhigh (67e100%), medium (34e66%) and low (0e33%).\nDo Rough Grunts Label Food Preference?\nRough grunts produced in response to foods of different\npreference categories had subtly different acoustic structures (Fig. 1). Visual examination of the spectrograms indicated that high-preference foods elicited calls with a clear\nharmonic structure, a high peak frequency and a long duration (Fig. 1a), whereas low-preference foods elicited\nnoisy signals with no clear harmonic structure, a low\npeak frequency and a short duration (Fig. 1c). Mediumpreference foods elicited calls with structures that were\nintermediate to these two variants (Fig. 1b).\nFigure 2 illustrates the graded nature of the acoustic\nstructure of the rough grunts. Peak frequency increased\nas preference increased (R2 ¼ 0.3925, P < 0.001). Duration\n(R2 ¼ 0.0794, P ¼ 0.003) and first formant frequency\n(R2 ¼ 0.0692, P ¼ 0.005) also produced positive relations\nwith preference. There was no obvious relation between\nthe intercall duration and preference (R2 ¼ 0.0005;\nP ¼ 0.964).\nTable 1.

The ranks are assigned on the basis of the percentages for each individual.\nANIMAL BEHAVIOUR, 72, 5992An ANCOVA was run on 108 calls with peak frequency,\nintercall duration, duration and first formant frequency\nentered as covariates and individual as a fixed factor. The\nvariance inflation factors (VIF) of the independent variables were less than 1.5, indicating that colinearity was not\na problem. When combined in one model the variables\nsuccessfully predicted the individuals’ preference ratings\nfor the food that elicited the grunts (F7,100 ¼ 11.70,\nP < 0.001, Radj\n2 ¼ 0.452), indicating that the acoustic\nstructure of the rough grunts varied significantly with\nindividual preferences. Peak frequency made the most\nimportant contribution (F1,100 ¼ 58.73, P < 0.001), followed by call duration (F1,100 ¼ 3.29, P ¼ 0.073). Intercall\nduration and first formant frequency did not vary significantly with preference (intercall duration: F1,100 ¼ 1.09,\nP ¼ 0.304; first formant frequency: F1,100 ¼ 0.02, P ¼\n0.948), consistent with the patterns observed in Fig. 2.\nAny systematic individual variation was controlled for in\nthis analysis and individual did not make a significant contribution to the model (F3,100 ¼ 1.793, P ¼ 0.153).\nThese patterns remained consistent with the smaller\npreference data sets provided to match the food type\nanalyses. More specifically, calls given to foods of the three\ndifferent preference categories differed significantly in\npeak frequency (Table 2). In addition, more than half\nthe analyses revealed significant differences in duration\nand intercall duration between the calls given to foods\nof different preference categories (Table 2). All the discriminant functions, derived from the four variables describing\nthe acoustic structure of rough grunts given to high-, medium- and low-preference foods, explained a significant\namount of variation between grunts given in response\nto foods from the three different preference categories\n(Table 3). The functions all correctly classified calls,\naccording to the preference category of food that had\nelicited them, at a level significantly above that expected\nby chance (Table 3). This confirms that rough grunts given\nto foods of different preferences have consistently and significantly different acoustic structures.\nDo Rough Grunts Label Food Type?\nResults so far are consistent with the ‘preference’\nhypothesis in demonstrating that the acoustic structure\nof rough grunts could be explained by individuals\nresponding to low-, medium- or high-preference foods.\nHowever, it is also possible that the chimpanzees were\nproducing acoustically distinct grunts to individual food\ntypes. Given the high correlation observed between food\ntype and preference rating (Table 1), we had to control for\npreference to investigate whether rough grunts labelled\nspecific food types. We therefore examined grunts given\nto food types within the high-, medium- and low-preference categories separately.\nWe found that different types of high-preference foods\nelicited rough grunts that differed subtly, but significantly,\nin their acoustic structures. The mixed-design ANOVAs\nrevealed that the acoustic structure of bread, banana and\nmango calls varied significantly, especially with regard to\nthe first formant frequencies and call durations (Table 2).\nThis variation was sufficient for all of the discriminant\nfunction analyses to classify correctly the calls according\nto the type of food that elicited them at a level above\nthat expected by chance (Table 3).\nIn contrast, there was no evidence that the rough grunts\ngiven to different types of medium- or low-preference\nfoods differed in their acoustic structures. The mixeddesign ANOVAs revealed that the grunts given to mediumpreference foods, chow, plums and grapes, did not differ\non any of the four acoustic variables (Table 2).

These calling bouts were\nselected on the basis of their clarity and freedom from interference\nfrom other sources of noise such as other chimpanzee calls.\nSLOCOMBE & ZUBERBU ̈ HLER: FOOD-ASSOCIATED CALLS 993remained stable across all three iterations we ran. Similarly, no significant acoustic differences were found between the grunts given to low-preference foods, apples,\ncarrots and greens (Table 2). Discriminant function analyses were unable to discriminate correctly between calls\ngiven to plums, chow and grapes or between calls given\nto carrots, greens and apples (Table 3).\nThe results obtained so far indicate that chimpanzees,\ndespite having a preference-driven calling system, can\neffectively label specific food types, at least within the\nhighly preferred food class (bread, banana, mango). For\nthis to be of theoretical importance (i.e. whether calls\nfunction as labels for food items), however, acoustic\nstructures need to be consistent from one feeding event\nto the next. We thus compared the calls produced by three\nindividuals, Emma, Louis and Quafzeh, to bananas\nand bread on 3 separate days (27 calls to bread and 27\ncalls to bananas, respectively: 3 individuals \u0003 3 feeding\nevents \u0003 3 calls/bout). If the chimpanzees were labelling\nfood types, then there should be no difference between\nthe calls given in response to the three different feeding\nevents. Consistent with this hypothesis, our mixed-design\nANOVAs failed to reveal any significant differences in the\nacoustic structure of calls given to banana on the 3 days.\nThe calls given to bread varied only in terms of the intercall duration (F1,7 ¼ 8.47, P < 0.05). Cross-validated\ndiscriminant function analyses were equally unable to account for a significant amount of variance between the\ncalls given to ‘bread’ or ‘banana’ in the three feeding\nevents (bananas: Wilk’s l ¼ 0.808; c2\n8 ¼ 4:792; 22.2% correctly classified; binomial (0.33), two-tailed, P ¼ 0.324;\nbread: Wilk’s l ¼ 0.453; c2\n8 ¼ 17:810; 48.1% correctly classified; binomial (0.33), two-tailed, P ¼ 0.148).\nFood-Associated Calls in Wild Chimpanzees\nThe data set composition for the wild chimpanzees was\nidentical to the high-preference food type data set from\nthe captive individuals (N ¼ 36: 4 individuals \u0003 3\nfoods \u0003 3 calls/bout), which enabled us to make some direct comparisons.

The mean\npeak frequency and duration of the wild calls were intermediate to the mean values of high- and medium-preference foods in the captive individuals. Wild chimpanzees\nalso gave rough grunts with intercall periods and first formant frequencies similar to those given by captive chimpanzees to high- and medium-preference types of food.\nOur previous analyses showed that captive chimpanzees\ngave acoustically distinct rough grunt calls to three highly\npreferred food types. However, a mixed-design ANOVA\nrevealed that the rough grunts elicited by CYN, Fe and FSu\nfruits did not differ in peak frequency (F2,16 ¼ 2.53,\nP ¼ 0.111), duration (F1.0,8.2 ¼ 2.04, P ¼ 0.191) or first formant frequency (F2,16 ¼ 0.39, P ¼ 0.685). The only parameter that differed significantly between the grunts given to\nthe three wild food types was intercall duration\n(F1.2,9.4 ¼ 9.12, P ¼ 0.012). A discriminant function analysis was unable to account for a significant amount of variance between calls given to the three food types (Wilk’s\nl ¼ 0.705, c2\n8 ¼ 11:00, P ¼ 0.201). The function correctly\nclassified only 41.7% calls (cross-validated) according to\nthe type of food that elicited them, a level expected by\nchance (binomial (0.33), P ¼ 0.252, two-tailed).\nDISCUSSION\nThis study has shown that chimpanzees produce rough\ngrunt calls with different acoustic structures that vary\naccording to the relative preference of the food encountered. Our analyses showed that chimpanzee rough grunts\nare a graded acoustic signal, in which differences in food\npreference have direct effects on the calls’ acoustic\nstructure (Fig. 2). Effects were primarily observed on the\npeak frequency and duration of calls, with highly preferred food eliciting long signals with high peak\nfrequencies, whereas least preferred food elicited short\nsignals with low peak frequencies. Medium-preference\nfoods elicited calls with an acoustic structure intermediate\nTable 2.

Although rough grunts varied\nsystematically with food preference, which consistently\naccounted for more of the variance in the acoustic structure of the calls than the type of food, our subsequent\nanalyses showed that this vocal system is capable of incorporating more than just three preference categories.\nWithin the highly preferred category, calls could potentially function as labels for individual food items: discriminant function analyses were able to classify correctly\na significant number of rough grunts to bananas, bread\nand mangoes and these patterns remained stable over\ntime. Rough grunts given by members of the free-ranging\ncommunity at Budongo Forest in response to three preferred foods were acoustically very similar to the ones\ngiven by the captive individuals to medium- or high-preference foods. More complex comparisons were not possible because of the difficulties in accurately assessing food\nquality or preference in the wild.\nPsychological Mechanisms\nThe psychological mechanisms underlying call production in chimpanzees are not well understood. In chickens\nand some New World primates, differences in food\npreference affect calling rates, that is, the duration of\nintercall intervals. Chimpanzee rough grunting did not\nfollow this pattern because intercall intervals were unaffected by our measures of food preference. Chimpanzee\nrough grunts may thus be more analogous to the calling\nbehaviour of rhesus macaques in which call types vary\nacoustically with food preference, whereas call rate is\nmerely mediated by hunger. In chimpanzees, social factors\nare also likely to be important for call production, a virtually\nunexplored topic that deserves more systematic attention.\nObservations such as the ones reported in chickens are\nusually taken to argue that calling behaviour is driven by\nthe caller’s level of ‘excitement’, an explanation that\nmakes intuitive sense. Although widespread in the animal\ncommunication literature, this and related terminology\n(‘affect’, ‘motivation’, ‘emotion’ or ‘arousal’) are usually\nnot further specified, and it is rarely made explicit what\nsets of behavioural parameters or physiological processes\nthey describe, apart from the vocal behaviour they are\nseeking to explain. Nevertheless, the notion of ‘affective\nsignals’ is widespread and typically pitted against what is\nconceived as the less parsimonious alternatives, ‘referential signalling’, ‘mental representation’, ‘cognitive processing’ or the like. We prefer to remain agnostic about how\nbest to conceptualize the psychological mechanisms underlying chimpanzee rough grunts. Currently, there is\nTable 3.

Acoustic energy is depicted by the darkness of the image.\nANIMAL BEHAVIOUR, 72, 5996insufficient evidence to make any assumptions about the\nmechanisms driving call production. This includes\nwhether chimpanzees are intentionally producing grunts\nthat can provide listening individuals with information\nabout the nature of discovered food sources. What can be\nsaid with some certainty is that call production must be\nthe result of the individuals’ prior experiences with the\nparticular foods, as well as the social effects of call\nproduction. Whether this should be called an ‘affective’\nresponse does not really increase our understanding in\nrelevant ways (Seyfarth & Cheney 2003).\nAnother line of reasoning, often invoked in this context,\nconcerns the question of how signal structure relates to\nbiological function. Morton (1977) has been particularly\ninfluential in this debate and other more recent approaches have also sought to understand the effect of receiver psychology on the evolution of signal design\n(Guilford & Dawkins 1993). It may be of relevance that\nthe preferred foods in our study tended to elicit rough\ngrunts with higher frequencies, rather than the other\nway around. For example, callers may be more likely to experience agonistic interactions in the presence of highly\npreferred foods, and it may be this social dimension that\nultimately drives their vocal behaviour. Morton’s (1977)\nlaw states that higher-pitched calls are typically produced\nby fearful animals or individuals seeking to appease others.\nVariation with Food Preference or Food Type?\nOur results also show that captive chimpanzees produce\nacoustically distinct rough grunts to different types of\nhigh-preference food, suggesting a process of vocal individuation for food items. Comparable findings were not\navailable for rough grunts given to medium- or lowpreference foods, suggesting that individuals make finegrained distinctions only between highly preferred foods.\nCalls produced to the highly preferred foods bread and\nbananas were structurally consistent across feeding\nevents, suggesting that these calls could provide recipients\nwith reliable labels for specific food types. The fact that\nrough grunts are graded signals does not preclude them\na priori from serving as referential signals. Research on\nbaboons, Papio cynocephalus ursinus, has shown that individuals perceive acoustically graded calls as discrete units\n(e.g. Fischer et al. 2001).\nOur findings thus seem to provide some support for the\nhypothesis that rough grunts can function as labels for\nparticular food items (Hallberg et al. 2003), although ecologically valid playback studies are still needed to elucidate\nthe exact information content of these calls from the listener’s perspective. However, we were unable to replicate\nthis finding with data from the wild. There was no evidence that the Budongo chimpanzees used acoustically\ndistinct labels for different types of highly preferred foods.\nWhat can explain the differences between the results obtained for the wild and captive populations? We can think\nof at least three explanations.\nFirst, our preference judgments for the three foods in\nthe wild might have been inaccurate. We had no way of\nobjectively testing food preferences in the wild and\nalthough proportion of time spent eating certain items is\naccepted as a good index of preference, it has limitations.\nIt cannot be used to determine relative preferences of\ncommon and rare foods, or the preference of foods eaten\nin the study period compared with those available at other\ntimes of the year. The categorization of the three species of\nfood as ‘high preference’ might therefore have been an\noverestimate. Rough grunts produced to these three foods\nfell somewhere in between the grunts given by captive\nindividuals to high- and medium-preference foods (Table\n4), supporting this view.

The situation in captivity is\nvery different because food availability, quality and quantity are predictable. During the study period the captive\npopulation regularly received 20 different foods in sufficient quantities for all individuals to be able to obtain\nsome. They received four food types every day, 11 other\nfoods at least once a week and five other foods at least\nonce every month. The food was always of high quality\n(ripe, fresh) and the quantity varied only trivially. In\naddition, individuals in captivity could always see all\nother group members and observe their choices and\ncalling behaviour closely. In contrast, in the wild the\nquality, quantity and availability of food are highly variable. The quality of a food source is reliant on the ripeness\nof the fruit or the age of the leaves. The quantity of the\nfood source is determined by the size of the tree or food\npatch and also its state of depletion. Foods are usually\nhighly seasonal (e.g. Cynometra alexandri) or follow unpredictable fruiting patterns (e.g. Ficus species). This means\nthat the probability of obtaining a certain food has to be\ntracked over seasons, not just a few weeks, or it is highly\nunpredictable. In addition, wild chimpanzees forage over\na large home range, often in a low-visibility habitat, in\na fissionefusion social system; it is therefore not possible\nfor individuals to observe all the feeding choices and\ncalling behaviour of all community members, as it is in\ncaptivity. This limits the opportunity for signallers to\nmonitor the reactions of others to call variants and for listeners to learn the contingencies between individual call\nvariants and the eliciting contexts; both processes are proposed to be important factors in the development of an effective communication system (Owings & Morton 1998).\nThe scale of variation that wild chimpanzees are confronted with in terms of number of food types (e.g. tree\nspecies, fruits, leaves, flowers), quality (e.g. ripeness),\nquantity (e.g. patch size, depletion state) and availability\n(e.g. seasonal variation) is enormous. In light of these factors the emergence of individualized food labels seems to\nbe a rather unlikely event. In contrast, for captive animals\nfood type automatically becomes the key factor in determining the relative value of a food source, since all other\nvariables remain fairly constant. This may explain why we\nwere able to associate some rough grunt variants with particular food types (Table 2).\nThird, it may not be necessary for individuals in the\nwild to provide individual labels for particular food types.\nIt has repeatedly been suggested that wild chimpanzees\npossess sophisticated knowledge of the distribution of key\nfood trees throughout their home range (Goodall 1986;\nBoesch & Boesch-Achermann 2000; Bates 2005). A communication system capable of encoding the relative value\nof a food source, rather than the actual food type, may\nthus be sufficient since experienced listeners can infer\nthe type of food from the location of the caller. A recent\nplayback study describing responses to grunts produced\nto apples and bread corroborates this view (Slocombe &\nZuberbu ̈hler 2005).\nIn sum, our findings are most compatible with the idea\nthat captive chimpanzees can converge on idiosyncratic\nsemantic conventions, in which particular rough grunt\ntypes become meaningful labels by referring to specific\nfood items, such as bread or bananas. However, this may\nbe possible only in a setting where most aspects of feeding\nevents are predictable and regular and the type of food\nbecomes the principal determinant of food value. When\nthe differences in the relative preferences for foods are\nsufficiently large, as bread, mango and banana were in our\nstudy group, a preference-driven calling system can\ndifferentiate between them. Equally, these differences in\ncalling can become meaningful to listeners in captivity\nbecause individuals usually eat in sight of one another and\ncan observe individual food choices and calling behaviours. It may therefore be possible for listeners to infer the\ntype of food referenced by a call, although it is still\nessentially a marker of relative food value.\nIn conclusion, chimpanzees produce rough grunts with\nacoustic structures that vary as a function of preference for\nthe food they discover. In the restricted setting of captivity\nthis system can obtain naming functions, in which calls\nmay refer to particular types of foods. Data from the wild\nshow a broad similarity between the calling behaviour of\nwild and captive chimpanzees, providing the captive\nresults with ecological validity. However, unlike the\ncaptive chimpanzees, there is no evidence that wild\nchimpanzees produce acoustically distinct calls to different food types. In the wild, the exact meaning of calls may\nbe the product of call type and context (e.g. Smith 1977).\nAcknowledgments\nWe are very grateful to the Royal Zoological Society of\nScotland for allowing work to be conducted at Edinburgh\nZoo.

Yip\nDepartment of Phonetics and Linguistics, UCL, Gower Street, London, WC1E 6PT, UK\nHuman language draws on a complex set of cognitive,\nmotor and auditory skills. Some of these are found in\nother species but others are thought to be absent. There\nhas been a burst of research in this area over the past\nfive years, both in examining natural communication\nsystems and also in the laboratory, exposing animals\nto human language. Most of the work has focused on\nanalogies to syntax. Although many of the fundamental\nbuilding blocks for basic phonological skills might be\nfound outside humans, most aspects of core phonology\nhave never been investigated.\nIntroduction\nThe issue of the extent to which language is the result of\nmechanisms that are specifically human, and specific to\nlanguage, has been the subject of a recent debate between\nHauser, Chomksy and Fitch [1,2], on the one hand, and\nPinker and Jackendoff [3,4] on the other; however, the\nauthors focus mainly on syntax and say little about phonology. The idea that animal vocalizations might show\nanalogues to human phonology is not new (sometimes\ncalled ‘phonological syntax’ or ‘phonocoding’ [5]) but the\ndebate has largely ignored late 20th century advances in\nphonological theory. Here, I start from the perspective of a\nphonologist, identify the core properties of phonological\nsystems and then ask which, if any, are found outside\nhumans, and which, if any, are absent in at least some\nnon-human animals. Not surprisingly, it turns out that\nwe have very few answers to these questions, so the logical\nnext step is to design experiments to test for these\nphonological skills. Speech production and speech\nperception are not discussed here; these have been\nreviewed elsewhere [6,7].\nHuman phonological skills\nMy focus is on the basic skills without which phonology\ncannot exist. Although necessary, they might well not be\nsufficient but they are a starting point for investigation.\nDetailed background on phonology is not included here but\ncan be found elsewhere [8].\nIt is useful to divide our phonological knowledge into\nmatters relating to the sounds themselves, and to the\nstructures in which they occur. I start with the sounds.\nEarly in acquisition we acquire the distinctions found in\nour ambient language, and our ability to distinguish other\nsounds fades away [9]. We also exhibit an awareness of\nprototypes for these linguistic categories, something called\nthe ‘perceptual magnet effect’ [10]. At the completion of\nthis process, we have acquired the inventory of sounds of\nour language, and the ability to produce them accurately,\nwhich implies the ability to imitate. With the sounds in\nplace, phonology proper begins to emerge. Sounds are\ngrouped into natural classes (Box 1 defines this and other\nlinguistic terms), and these are used to learn a set of\nregular patterns of distribution, and of alternations that\nare systematic and rule governed. Some of these patterns\nmight be arbitrary [11], although we might be better at\nlearning phonetically natural patterns [12,13]. Among the\nmany mechanisms needed to explain these processes is\nthe ability to compute identity, whether total or partial,\nand over nonadjacent as well as adjacent sounds. Some\nlanguages ban identity – for example, words that contain\ntwo identical or similar consonants [14]. Other language\nprocesses require identity – for example, vowel harmony\n(Figure 1a) in Turkic languages, and poetic rhyme.\nTurning to structures, sounds group themselves into\nlarger units, including syllable, stress foot, prosodic word\nand phonological phrase [15], and phonological processes\ncan pay attention to these units. We have the ability to pay\nattention to statistical distributions, both as adults [16]\nand in acquisition [17]. This ability to make use of transitional probabilities extends in human infants to nonadjacent consonants or nonadjacent vowels [18]. Infants and\nadults can distinguish between two prosodically distinct\nlanguages, even when the segmental content is drastically\nsimplified [19,20], so that the languages differ only in\nsyllable structure, foot structure and intonation structure.\nAre these abilities found in other animals?\nWe need to distinguish between evidence that animals\nhave analogues of these abilities in their own communication systems, and evidence that they are able to recognize\nthe sounds and structures of human language. One caveat\nis that a standard tool in human phonology is the minimal\npair: a change in one phoneme changes the meaning.\nWorking with other species, meanings cannot normally\nbe identified, so we have to use different ways of establishing whether the subparts of a signal have cognitive\nsignificance.\nA summary of some relevant facts from a disparate\nrange of species is given in Box 2. It should be clear that\nwe know astonishingly little, although at a minimum\nsome animals show evidence of categorical perception,\nthe ability to imitate, the combining of small phoneme-like\nunits into larger hierarchical structures, an ability to pay\nOpinion TRENDS in Cognitive Sciences Vol.10 No.10\nCorresponding author: Yip, M.J.

If we look at their ability to handle human speech\nsounds, we see plentiful evidence of categorical perception\n[21], and perhaps of the perceptual magnet effect, which\nhas been found in starlings [22] (Figure 2), although not in\nmonkeys [10].\nWhen it comes to human sounds in combination, the\nbulk of the recent careful work has been done with cottontop tamarins (Saguinus oedipus oedipus), a small primate\neasily studied in the laboratory. Tamarins, like human\ninfants, can distinguish between rhythmically different\nlanguages [23] of the foot- versus syllable-timed varieties,\nsuch as Dutch and Japanese [19], but not between\nrhythmically similar languages, such as Dutch and\nEnglish [24]. However, if the segmental contrasts are\nreduced to manner distinctions only (Figure 1c), the tamarins’ performance deteriorates somewhat [19] (whereas for\nrats [25] it remains robust).\nTurning to structural distinctions, tamarins, similarly\nto infants, can track transitional probabilities for adjacent\nsyllables [26] and for nonadjacent probabilities involving\nvowels [11]. After that, things diverge: infants can do this\nfor nonadjacent consonants but not for nonadjacent syllables, whereas tamarins can do it for nonadjacent syllables\nbut not for consonants.\nRecent work [27] has suggested that starlings can learn\nnew rules for the temporal patterning of song motifs, which\nis not surprising, given that they apparently use temporal\npatterning to aid in the recognition of other individuals’\nsongs [28,29]. The authors also suggest that the starlings\ncan learn structures of the form A n B n (which resemble\nreduplicative patterns for AB base forms in some Chinese\nlanguages), although their claim that these structures\nare recursive is hotly disputed.\nAdding this to what we know about their natural vocalizations, we can say that some animals show evidence of\nan ability to pay attention to transitional probabilities,\nincluding nonadjacent ones, and a possible sensitivity to\nprosody.\nDespite this impressive list, a range of other skills that\ncontribute to human phonology remains unexplored in\nother species. There is no literature that looks at such\nthings as an awareness of natural classes, the ability to\nBox 1.

(c) Experimental manipulation in which distinctions of\nplace of articulation and of voicing are removed, and only the manner of articulation\ndifferences are retained. All consonants are now alveolar and voiceless.\nBox 2. Natural animal vocalizations\nAnimal vocalizations can usefully be divided into apparently innate\nunlearnt signals versus complex learnt vocalizations [33]. Innate\nsystems can be found at both extremes of the animal kingdom – for\nexample, in crickets, frogs and gibbons. Even these systems show\nsome similarities with human language. Crickets [34] show\ncategorical perception in distinguishing conspecific calls from those\nof bats, and this ability has now been found in a wide range of\nspecies, including swamp sparrows [35], macaques [36] and\nbaboons [37]. Female Acheta domesticus crickets prefer rhythmic\nmale songs [38]. Turning to gibbons, the most noticeable aspect of\ntheir famous duets is the female great call [39], in which the illusion\nof rhythm is probably more related to breathing patterns than to\ncognitive organization.\nMore interesting for our purposes are the species that show vocal\nlearning, mainly passerine birds [30,40], cetaceans and pinnipeds\n[33]. Learning takes place not only in acquisition, but, for many\nspecies, also during adulthood. This later learning can be seen in\nspecies that imitate the calls of other species, such as the starling\nand the mockingbird, in vocal play in parrots [41] and also in\nintraspecies countersinging [42], and in the change over time of the\nsongs of the humpback whale [43]. The analogies to human\nlanguage are clear: humans can acquire new accents as adults\n[44], and even second languages [45]. The really striking characteristics of these learned songs are their hierarchical structures\n[29,40,43,46,47]. The details vary but the smallest units, the notes\n(sometimes compared with phonemes), are grouped into higher\nlevel constituents in structures highly reminiscent of the prosodic\nstructures of human language and music [15,33,48]. Within each\nstarling song bout, the transitional probabilities of the song motifs\nare nonrandom. They appear to be distinctive for a particular bird,\nand have a significant effect on the ability of a bird to recognize\nanother individual’s song [29]. It has also been suggested that\nsome species use rhyme in their songs [43,49,50], possibly as an\naide-me ́moire.\nOpinion TRENDS in Cognitive Sciences Vol.10 No.10 443\nwww.sciencedirect.comdiscriminate trochaic from iambic rhythm, or initial from\nfinal stress or lengthening as a marker of prosodic structure, the ability to recognize ‘words’ even if altered by\nsystematic rule-governed alternations, or the ability to\nperform identity calculations\nHow can we test these skills further?\nIn this final section, I outline the types of experimental\nwork that might begin to address these issues. Although I\nmostly assume that tamarins would be used, other species\nmight be more suitable for some experiments. They are\nalmost all focused on asking to what extent animals\nevidence human-like abilities when confronted with\nhuman language, and thus on perception rather than\nproduction; however, eventually, of course, one would need\nto tackle the even harder task of searching in their natural\ncommunications as well. A final point is that in each case,\nthe work would also need to be carried out in adults and\ninfants if any human-animal comparison is to be made.\nPhonemes\nThe notes of birdsongs are often compared with phonemes.\nThe usual test for a phoneme is a minimal pair, such as\n‘din’ versus ‘tin’. Using techniques drawn from the work of\nGentner [29], one could synthetically edit starling song\nmotifs so that they differ only in a single note, and then\nsubstitute one motif for the other. If the notes are truly\nphoneme-like, this change should significantly affect song\nrecognition by other starlings (the closest analogue to a\nphoneme switch affecting lexical meaning in humans). The\ncontrol conditions would use unaltered motifs (when recognition should be unimpaired), or motifs with much more\ndrastic alterations (when recognition should be clearly\nimpaired). The same technique could be used to test the\neffect of alterations at intermediate levels, such as syllable\nor ‘feature’ [30].\nNatural classes\nOne way to explore the existence of natural classes is\nbased loosely on techniques with human artificial\nlanguage-learning [31]. One could habituate tamarins to\na pseudolanguage composed of both stops and fricatives,\nand in which all ‘words’ start with stops but with no\n[p]-initial words. We then introduce two new languages:\none with [p]-initial words added and one with [f]-initial\nwords added (plus a control condition with new words but\nno new segments). If natural classes have a role, the\naddition of [f]-initial words should be more noticeable than\nthe addition of [p]-initial words because it creates an\nentirely new type of word, beginning with a fricative. To\ntest this, we can use head orientation to the loudspeaker as\nan indication that a difference has been perceived [19]. The\ntamarins should orientate significantly more often to the\nloudspeaker in this f-condition than in the p-condition.\nThis technique can also be used in the remaining experiments discussed here, and will not be explained again.\nPhonological rules\nCan animals learn that two different sounds are variants of\na single phoneme, each appearing predictably in different\nenvironments? Subjects would be exposed to an artificial\nlanguage in which stop voicing is predictable, with the\nvoiced variant occurring between vowels (Figure 1b). In the\ntest phase, the voicing pattern is violated, with voiceless\nsounds appearing between vowels and/or voiced ones\nappearing in other contexts. The control condition would\nuse new words that conform to the original voicing pattern.\nIdentity computation\nOne could use two versions of a single test to establish\nwhether tamarins can learn that identity is obligatory, or\nwhether it is prohibited. Take two word-sets. Set A is a\nsimplified vowel-harmony language (such as Turkish) and\nhas only words with identical vowels, ‘tiki’, ‘kupu’, ‘kudu’,\n‘titi’. Set B is a dis-harmonic language (such as Ainu) and\nhas only words with nonidentical vowels, ‘diku’, ‘kupi’,\n‘kidu’, ‘tipu’. The tamarins are trained by exposure to\none or the other set, and in the test phase they are given\nnew words (created from the same syllables) from the\nfamiliar set, and new words from the unfamiliar set. Do\nthey orientate significantly more to the unfamiliar set?\nDiscriminating stress systems\nCan animals discriminate a pure prominence difference,\nwith syllable structure held constant? We expose the\ntamarins to an artificial language in which each of the\n‘words’ carries initial stress. Then we create two otherwise\nidentical languages, containing the same ‘words’, although\nin a different order; in one case, the words still carry initial\nstress but in the other, the words carry final stress. Will\nthey orient more in the second condition?\nConclusions\nReturning to the recent debate discussed earlier, the\nFaculty of Language in the Narrow sense (FLN), as defined\nby Hauser, Chomsky and Fitch [1,2], excludes any abilities\nfound even in vestigial form in other species, and by this\nstrict criterion it appears that, given the evidence summarized here, we must exclude from FLN categorical\nperception, rhythm, perhaps ‘prosody’, hierarchical structure and transitional probabilities (at least adjacent ones).\nFigure 2.

In such cases, Pinker and Jackendoff [3,4] would admit it into their looser version of FLN.\nThe questions asked so far are only a starting point. We\nare left with a long list of phonological skills whose\npresence in other species has never been investigated.\nThe real interest of human phonology rests in our ability\nto combine these relatively simple skills into more complex\ntasks, such as the ability to distinguish possible syllables of\nour language, such as ‘blick’, from impossible ones, such as\n‘bnick’; to assign stress on the basis of vowel length and\nsyllable structure; to produce and to understand contextual variants of sounds; to handle two or more interacting\nphonological processes, including cases where one process\nmasks the motivation for another one (‘opacity’), and so on.\nIf other species turn out to have the simple skills discussed\nearlier, the next question is to ask whether they are able to\ncombine them in these more cognitively demanding ways.\nSuppose the answer to this question were ‘yes’? A new\nquestion must then be asked: does the existence of apparently similar skills necessarily imply similar cognitive\nmechanisms or neural structures [32]?\nOne might also ask at what point we would claim to have\n‘found phonology’ in another species, and the answer would\nhave to be that only if all of these skills (and others not\nmentioned here) are present will we have found fully\nhuman-like phonology. If the missing skills were the same\nacross species, then we might have identified something\nspecific to humans, and thus a component of FLN, but if the\nmissing skills were different from species to species, we\nwould need a different explanation.\nOf course, a final puzzle arises if these abilities are\nfound not in our closest relatives, primates, but in evolutionarily distant species, such as songbirds or cetaceans.\nWhat then could have caused the cognitive leap from the\napes to the hominids?\nAcknowledgements\nThis paper has benefited greatly from the comments of Emmanuel\nDupoux, W.

Brown, University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM, and approved April 21, 2008 (received for review March 5, 2008)\nCategorical perception is common in humans, but it is not known\nwhether animals perceive continuous variation in their own multidimensional social signals categorically. There are two components to categorical perception: labeling and discrimination. In the\nfirst, continuously variable stimuli on each side of a category\nboundary are labeled. In the second, there is strong discrimination\nbetween stimuli from opposite sides of the boundary, whereas\nstimuli on the same side of the boundary are not discriminated.\nHere, we show that female tu´ ngara frogs respond categorically to\ncomplex mating calls that vary simultaneously along multiple\ndimensions and are within the natural range of signal variation. In\nresponse to a transect of synthetic stimuli that varied continuously\nand systematically in seven dimensions, female tu´ ngara frogs label\nmating calls as either conspecific or not conspecific. For pairs of\nstimuli that differed by the same magnitude, females discriminate\nthose in different categories but not those in the same category. In\naddition, latency to respond was significantly shorter when stimuli\nwere in the same versus different categories. Because responses to\nmating calls are critical in generating species recognition and\nsexual selection, this finding has implications for both animal\nperception and the influences of mate choice on the tempo and\nmode of evolution.\nanimal cognition \u0001 animal communication \u0001 mate choice \u0001\nphonotaxis \u0001 sexual selection\nAnimals use only a fraction of available sensory information\nto assess their worlds, and different animals can have access\nto different sets of data emanating from the same environmental\nor social stimuli (1). An animal’s perception of the world also can\nbe influenced by how that information is processed. One important factor is whether stimuli are perceived continuously or\nin discrete categories. Categorical perception in humans is well\nknown in color, speech, and facial discrimination (2–4). Other\nanimals exhibit categorical perception of human phonemes (5,\n6). In addition, a few nonhuman animals show categorization of\ntheir own signals: song variants in songbirds (7), ultrasonic\nvocalizations in mouse pups (8), and mating/bat echolocation\ncalls in crickets (9). In these animal studies, and most human\nstudies, however, stimuli varied along a single dimension. It is not\nknown, therefore, if categorical perception extends to the vast\nmajority of communication signals, which covary over multiple\ndimensions.\nPerception of social signals is a critical stage preceding many\nsocial decisions. One of the most important decisions an animal\nmakes is deciding with whom to mate. These decisions are\nusually informed by signals that vary between and within species\n(10). In most instances, females choose to mate with conspecifics\nrather than heterospecifics and choose the more attractive males\namong conspecifics (11, 12). Mating preferences can lead to\nreproductive isolation between groups, which in turn promotes\ntheir divergence into different species. In addition, preferences\nfor certain variants of signal traits among conspecifics can\ngenerate sexual selection and lead to the evolution of extreme\nmale traits. Thus the perceptual mechanisms underlying mate\nchoice can play an important role in evolution, but they are often\nignored (13).\nMany studies investigate how signal variation influences mate\nchoice. One result of such studies is the ‘‘preference function,’’\nin which the strength of preference is represented as a function\nof continuous variation in the mating signal (14–16). The\npreference function illustrates the nature of selection on male\ntraits and may influence how traits evolve. Contrary to the results\nof the present study, all studies to date show that a continuous\nchange in a signal parameter covaries with a continuous change\nin the strength of preference for that signal. Thus females\nrespond to mating signals, whether comparing the same or\ndifferent species, as being continuously more or less attractive.\nAn alternative perceptual mode that might underlie mate choice\nis categorical perception, in which stimuli are categorized dichotomously as preferred or nonpreferred. There is no evidence\nto date for categorical perception of mating signals, although few\nstudies have explicitly tested this hypothesis. We do so here by\nexamining female preferences for mating call variation in the\ntu´ngara frog, Physalaemus pustulosus.\nMost male frogs produce acoustic signals to attract females for\nmating, and females discriminate call variation between and\nwithin species (17). Females exhibit these preferences through\nphonotaxis, approach toward a mating call (18–21). Although\nthese experiments do not reveal the absolute potential for\ndiscriminating among stimuli, i.e., just noticeable differences,\nthey emphasize the more ecologically relevant category of just\nmeaningful differences and are thus more pertinent to the\nbehavioral and evolutionary consequences of perceptual processes (7, 9, 22).\nThe tu´ngara frog’s mating call is a downward frequency sweep,\nor ‘‘whine,’’ of \u0001300 ms (Fig. 1). Males can add ‘‘chucks’’ to the\nend of this call, which increases its attractiveness. The whine,\nhowever, is both necessary and sufficient to elicit phonotaxis\nfrom females, and all closely related species have whine-like calls\n(21). We examined female preferences in response to a series of\nsynthetic calls that varied continuously between the conspecific\nwhine and the call of an allopatric heterospecific, Physalaemus\ncoloradorum. A previous study demonstrated that female tu´ngara frogs recognize the P. coloradorum call but significantly\nprefer the conspecific call when given a two-choice test (21).\nSeven call parameters were adjusted by the same percentage to\nsynthesize calls intermediate between each of the species’ calls\n(PC series; Fig. 1); for example, the call PC25 has a fall time of\n298 ms, which is 25% different from the P. pustulosus fall time\nAuthor contributions: A.T.B. and M.J.R. designed research; A.T.B. and K.L.A. performed\nresearch; A.T.B. and M.J.R. analyzed data; and A.T.B., K.L.A., and M.J.R. wrote the paper.\nThe authors declare no conflict of interest.\nThis article is a PNAS Direct Submission.\n†A.T.B., K.L.A., and M.J.R. contributed equally to this work.\n‡To whom correspondence should be addressed.

Thus synthetic\ncalls of any ‘‘acoustic distance’’ (the overall summed difference\nof all seven call parameters) from the conspecific call can be\nsynthesized, and the difference between any pair of stimuli can\nbe easily ascertained (23); e.g., PC6 is 6% different from both the\nconspecific call (PC00) and the PC12 call. We used nine calls:\nPC50, PC37, PC31, PC25, PC18, PC12, PC6, PC00, and PC-6.\nSynthetic advertisement calls have been used previously to\nexplore mate choice in tu´ngara frogs, and among other findings\nthese studies have demonstrated that the synthetic versions of\nthe calls are treated no differently from natural stimuli (24).\nReproductively active females were collected in Gamboa,\nPanama´, and tested with two-choice phonotaxis experiments to\nassess their preferences. We used two-choice rather than onechoice tests because they better approximate natural mate choice\nconditions. In addition, two-choice tests are more sensitive to\ndifferences between stimuli and are thus conservative when\ntesting for categorical perception (25).\nResults\nIn the first battery of tests, we used the average synthetic version\nof the conspecific call (PC00) as a referent for exploring\ncategorization. Females discriminated between PC00 and the\nfour most different calls (PC12, P  0.001; PC25, P  0.006;\nPC37, P  0.057; PC50, P  0.001; Fig. 2). There was no\npreference, however, when PC00 was paired with the two most\nsimilar calls (PC-6, P  0.412; PC6, P  0.588; Fig. 2). A control\nexperiment in which PC00 was paired with itself yielded no\npreference (PC00, P  0.412; Fig. 2). The results of these\nexperiments demonstrated labeling; when compared to conspecific calls, the test calls were considered to be either conspecific\nor not conspecific.\nAnother hallmark of categorical perception is a lack of\ndiscrimination between stimuli within a category and strong\ndiscrimination between stimuli of similar difference but in\ndifferent categories. Given the suggestion of category labeling in\nthe above results, we tested the hypothesis that females should\ndiscriminate between two stimuli across categories, but not\nwithin each category, even as the stimuli within each pair\ndiffered by the same amount. We used a repeated-measures\ndesign wherein each female completed three experiments: PC00\nversus PC6, PC6 versus PC12, and PC12 versus PC18. We\npredicted that females would discriminate between PC6 versus\nPC12 but would not discriminate between the other two pairs\neven though the calls in each pair differed by 6%. As predicted,\nthere was no preference in the two within-category experiments\nof PC00 versus PC6 (P  0.443; Fig. 3a) and PC12 versus PC18,\nalthough the data suggested a trend toward a preference (P\n0.059). There was, as predicted, a strong preference in the\nbetween-category test, PC6 versus PC12 (P  0.001). In addition,\nthere was a significant overall Cochran’s Q for the three experiments (Q  6.81, P  0.03), resulting from a difference in\npreference between PC00 versus PC6 and between PC6 versus\nPC12 (Q  6.54, P  0.01, Bonferonni corrected). The remaining\ntwo pairwise comparisons were not significantly different (Fig.\n3a). Further support of categorical perception derives from\npairwise tests at the extremes of each category: PC18 versus\nPC25 (P  0.412) and PC25 versus PC31 (P  0.412).\nA common finding in categorical perception studies is that\nresponse times differ for within- and between-category discriminations (26–28). Pisoni and Tash (26) and Bornstein and Korda\n(27) found slower response times for evaluating betweencategory stimuli compared with equivalently different withincategory stimuli; this effect, however, was not analyzed statistically. Thus we compared response latencies for the experiments\nin Fig. 3a. The one-way ANOVA generated a marginally significant overall effect of experiment on latency (F  2.95, df  2,\nP  0.055; Fig. 3b). Planned independent contrasts showed that\nthe latencies for the between-category comparison were significantly greater than the two within-category comparisons (t147\n2.406, P  0.017; Fig. 3b).\nFig. 1.

Unlike previous animal studies,\nwe demonstrate that categorical perception can occur in a mate\nchoice context and is not restricted to a single acoustic dimension, as is true in all other studies of categorical perception, but\ncan also emerge in response to acoustic signals that vary in\nmultiple dimensions, a common feature of virtually all social\nsignals. In addition, the synthetic stimuli used in this study\ncomprised a range of acoustic variation that falls within that of\nthe study population’s calls as evaluated by using multidimensional scaling (Fig. S1). This natural intraspecific variation has\nnot yet been examined for patterns of continuous or categorical\nmate choice.\nOne interpretation of this study is that mate preference and\nstimulus variation is not always a simple function as is implicit in\nstudies of sexual selection by female choice. If that is the case,\nthen we might expect male traits to evolve in a more punctuated\nmode (29, 30). It also might suggest reexamination of the notion\nthat females assess continuous quantitative variation in display\ntraits as indicators of male genetic quality (31, 32). Recent\nstudies have investigated in great detail the scaling of male\nsignals in sexual selection (33); our study suggests that scaling\nof female preferences for these signals is worthy of similar\nattention.\nWe suggest that understanding perception of mating signals is\ncritical to a deep understanding of how species recognition\nevolves and how sexual selection generates some of the most\nextreme behaviors and morphologies in the animal kingdom.\nMaterials and Methods\nFemale frogs were collected between 1900 and 2200 h and tested between\n2200 and 0600 h during the summers of 2006 and 2007. After testing, females\nwere toe-clipped to avoid retesting them and returned to their original\ncapture site within 12 h of collection. Collection permits in Panama´ were\napproved by the Autoridad Nacional del Ambiente, and animal care and use\napproval was done under the University of Texas Institutional Animal Care and\nUse Committee (6041701). We tested 167 females (410 choice trials) during the\ncourse of this study. For the repeated measures component we randomized\nthe order in which the experiments were conducted. The average number of\ntests that each female participated in was 2.57, and the average number of\ntransects per female was 1.11. Females were highly responsive with successful\nchoices performed in 91.1% of trials.\nFrogs were tested under infrared light in a sound attenuating chamber\n(Acoustic Systems) measuring 2.7 \u0004 1.8 \u0004 1.78 m. Female behavior was\nobserved on a video monitor connected to an infrared camera on the chamber\nceiling. At the beginning of each phonotaxis test a female was placed under\na small cone in the center of the chamber floor. We broadcast the two test\nstimuli antiphonally from speakers located in the center of the walls at the two\npoles of the chamber. Stimuli were presented at a rate of one call per 2 s from\neach speaker, and speakers were calibrated to a peak amplitude of 82 dB\nsound pressure level (20 \u0001Pa). Between successive trials, stimuli were alternated between the two speakers to avoid a stimulus \u0004 side bias. We concurrently tested for side bias by using identical stimuli. Those results and an\nanalysis of the present data strongly demonstrate the lack of a side bias in this\nstudy.\nStimuli were presented for 3 min while the female was under the cone.\nThen the cone was raised and a phonotactic choice was scored if a female\napproached one of the two stimuli within a 10-cm radius without simply\nfollowing the wall. A female failed to exhibit a phonotactic choice if she was\nmotionless for the initial 5 min after the cone was raised or during any 2-min\ninterval thereafter. Finally, a female did not exhibit phonotaxis if she failed to\nmake a choice within 15 min after the cone was raised. In addition to\nmeasuring choice we recorded latency to choice.\nWe used a binomial test (one-tailed) to evaluate each experiment against\nthe null prediction of no preference (P  0.5); there was the a priori expectation that females prefer the conspecific call to alternatives (20). For repeated\nmeasures experiments we also used the nonparametric Cochran’s Q test to\nevaluate each female’s response under one experiment compared with the\nother two experiments. Response latencies for repeated-measures experiments were converted to subject z scores and analyzed with a one-way\nANOVA.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS.

F reeberg1\nDepartments of Psychology and Ecology & Evolutionary Biology, University of Tennessee, Knoxville, Tennessee 37996, USA\nAbstract.—Chick-a-dee calls are common vocal signals in chickadees (Poecile spp.) that function in social organization. Earlier\nwork indicated that the call is a structurally complex vocal system, in that it is open-ended and, theoretically, could convey a large\namount of information. However, little quantitative empirical work has addressed whether signalers actually produce distinct chick-\na-dee calls in different environmental or behavioral contexts. I tested this question in an eastern population of Carolina Chickadees\n(Poecile carolinensis). Calls were recorded from free-living birds, and contextual variables were noted at the time of call production.\nThe structure of the chick-a-dee call—the average number of note types used in calls and the different categories of note composition\nused commonly by birds—was associated with a diverse set of variables, including the proximity of the signaler to the ground, the\nsignaler’s flight behavior and local population, and the presence of an avian predator. These results suggest that a receiver could gain\nconsiderable information about the signaler and its immediate environment from the different uses of note types in a signaler’s calls.\nFurthermore, these findings support the notion, raised in earlier studies, that the chick-a-dee call is structurally and informationally\ncomplex.

Cependant, peu de travail empirique quantitatif a\nété effectué avec les espèces de Poecile pour examiner si les émetteurs des vocalisations produisent vraiment des cris «chick-a-dee»\ndistincts en fonction des différents contextes environnementaux ou comportementaux. La présente étude a examiné cette question\ndans une population de Poecile carolinensis du sud-est des États-Unis. Les vocalisations «chick-a-dee» d’oiseaux sauvages ont été en-\nregistrées et des variables contextuelles ont été notées lors de la production de cris. Les données indiquent que la structure des cris\n«chick-a-dee»—le nombre moyen de types de notes utilisés dans les cris et les catégories différentes de composition de notes utilisées\ncommunément par les oiseaux—est associée de manière distincte à un ensemble de variables diverses, telles que la hauteur à laquelle le\nsignaleur se trouve, le comportement de vol du signaleur et sa population locale, ainsi que la présence d’un prédateur avien. Ces résul-\ntats suggèrent qu’un récepteur pourrait acquérir des informations considérables sur le signaleur et sur son environnement immédiat à\npartir de l’organisation des types de notes produits par le signaleur. En outre, ces conclusions sont en accord avec les premières études\nsur la complexité structurelle et informationnelle des cris «chick-a-dee».\n— 896 —\nThe Auk 125(4):896–907, 2008\n The American Ornithologists’ Union, 2008.2008..\nPrinted in USA.\n1E-mail: tfreeber@utk.edu\nThe Auk, Vol. 125, Number 4, pages 896–907.

Animals in social groups frequently use vocal sig-\nnals to communicate with one another. Vocal signals provide an\neffective means of communicating about signaler state, as well as\nabout relatively moment-by-moment changes in the signaler’s\nbehavioral or physical environmental situation, particularly if group\nmembers are out of visual contact with one another (Bradbury and\nVehrencamp 1998).\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/auk/article/125/4/896/5148299 by University of Maryland College Park user on 13 January 2026ocTober 2008 — conTexT and C hiCk-a - dee call STrucTure — 897\nChickadees of the genus Poecile possess diverse vocal reper-\ntoires (Hailman 1989, Hailman and Ficken 1996). A frequently used\nvocalization is the chick-a-dee call, which functions in social orga-\nnization and has been studied most thoroughly in Black-capped\nChickadees (Poecile atricapillus; Hailman et al. 1985, 1987; Hailman\nand Ficken 1986). The call of Black-capped Chickadees comprises\nfour distinct note types that can occur or not in any given call and\ncan, if present, occur more than once and follow fairly strict note-\nordering rules. These characteristics of chick-a-dee calls (presence,\nnumber, and ordering of note types) result in a call system that is\nfunctionally open-ended in the diversity of unique call types a bird\ncan produce. Furthermore, the amount of information (bits) in the\ncall system is quite high (Hailman et al. 1985). An assumption of\nall this work is that structurally different calls represent distinct\nmessages and may have distinct meanings to the birds themselves.\nRecent evidence, mainly from Black-capped Chickadees, increas-\ningly supports this assumption (e.g., Templeton et al. 2005; reviewed\nin Lucas and Freeberg 2007).\nTo understand the function of communicative signals,\nresearchers ultimately need to address the signaler, the signal, the\nreceiver, and the contexts in which communication occurs (Smith\n1977, Leger 1993, Wiley 1994, Hauser 1996, Owings and Morton\n1998). Ideally, these issues should be addressed with animals in\ntheir natural environments. An important first step in uncovering\nsignal function in a species is to focus on the production of sig-\nnals by signalers, to determine the conditions under which signals\nare produced and what the potential messages of signals might be.\nSome studies in Poecile have taken this approach in addressing\nwhether structurally distinct chick-a-dee calls are produced reli-\nably in different contexts. Ficken et al. (1994) found that contex-\ntual factors influenced the note composition of calls in Mexican\nChickadees (P. sclateri). For example, calls produced by Mexican\nChickadees in undisturbed contexts, such as having the mate\nnearby or in normal mixed-species flock settings, were structur-\nally different from calls produced by birds in disturbed contexts,\nsuch as an observer near the pair’s nest or the playback of calls of\nan avian predator (Ficken et al. 1994. In her monograph on vocal-\nizations in Carolina Chickadees (P. carolinensis), Smith (1972)\nsuggested that the relative use of different note types in chick-\na-dee calls varied with context. Contextual variables—including\nCarolina Chickadees mobbing a predator, detecting a predator,\napproaching a feeder, and forming breeding pairs—were com-\npared with the basis of different note types in the call in terms\nof whether each note type was rare, infrequent, frequent, or very\ncommon, but no quantitative data or statistical tests were reported\n(e.g., table 5.1 in Smith 1972). In a study of Mountain Chickadees\n(P. gambeli), Gaddis (1985) found that the notes of calls were used\nwith different frequencies in different contexts, including when\nindividuals approached a foraging site, left a foraging site, or\nwere startled. However, as with Smith’s (1972) study, the results\nwere largely qualitative. More recently, Baker and Becker (2002)\nand Templeton et al. (2005) demonstrated that captive Black-\ncapped Chickadees produce chick-a-dee calls with distinct note\ncompositions in contexts of increased threat by avian predators\nas compared with contexts with less predator threat. Given the\narguments that a large amount of information may be conveyed\nby the structural complexity of the chick-a-dee call but the relative\npaucity of quantitative data from natural groups of chickadees,\nI assessed whether Carolina Chickadee signalers produce different\ncall structures in different contexts.\nM ethods\nrecordings\nI recorded flocks of Carolina Chickadees from January to March\n2003 at 40 recording sites spread across three locations in eastern\nTennessee. The three locations were the University of Tennessee\nForest Resources, Research, and Education Center (“UTFRREC”;\n2,200 acres in Anderson County, Tennessee; 15 recording sites),\nNorris Dam State Park (“NDSP”; 4,000 acres in Anderson County;\n15 recording sites), and the Ijams Nature Center and adjacent\nForks of the River Wildlife Management Area (“Ijams”; 300 acres\nin Knox County; 10 recording sites); each location was ≥25 km\nfrom the other two locations. These three locations are part of the\nmixed oak–chestnut forests of the southern hardwood forest\nregion, located in a broad valley between the Cumberland Moun-\ntains and the Blue Ridge Mountains, and are dominated by mixed\ntree species, including oaks (Quercus spp.), hickories (Carya spp.),\npines (Pinus spp.), and Tuliptree (Liriodendron tulipifera) (Smith\nand Linnartz 1980). None of the birds recorded in the present\nstudy was banded. To try to ensure independence of sampling for\nthe 40 recording sites, each recording site within a location was\nseparated by ≥400 m from the nearest recording site. (Recent\nrecording data indicate that this distance provides strong inde-\npendence across recording sites—of 60 uniquely color-marked\nbirds recorded at 15 recording sites, 58 [96%] were recorded at only\none recording site and the other two individuals were recorded at\ntwo adjacent recording sites.)\nCalls of Carolina Chickadees were recorded with Sennheiser\nME-62, ME-66, and ME-67 microphones on Maxell XL-II tape\nwith a Marantz PMD-222 cassette recorder. I obtained 45 min of\nrecording at each recording site, because preliminary field record\nings indicated that this amount of recording would result in\n~100 chick-a-dee calls. To link calls with signalers and contexts,\nI approached very quietly to get as close to the vocalizing birds as\nI could without disrupting their normal behavior. In cases where\ncalls were recorded from individuals that I could not locate (because\nof vegetation, etc.), I was unable to determine certain contextual\nvariables (distance above ground, distance from observer, flight\nbehavior, etc.—described below) for those calls.\nContextual variables\nTime of day.—Calls were recorded in two time-frames. The\n“morning” time (20 recording sites) began 1 h and ended 4 h after\nsunrise (EST). The “noon” time (20 recording sites) began 5 h and\nended 8 h after sunrise. Time of day was assessed because activity\npatterns, body mass, energy levels, and foraging patterns change\nover the course of a day in chickadees and related species and may\ninfluence birds’ vocal production (Chaplin 1974, Reinertsen and\nHaftorn 1983, Lucas et al. 1999, Barluenga et al. 2003).\nLocation.—Recordings were obtained from birds at the three\nlocations: Ijams, NDSP, and UTFRREC. An earlier study with a\ndifferent population of Carolina Chickadees found that the calls of\nbirds sampled from areas separated by as little as 5 km could differ\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/auk/article/125/4/896/5148299 by University of Maryland College Park user on 13 January 2026898 — Todd M. Freeberg — auk , Vol . 125\nin some of the acoustical parameters of the notes (Freeberg et al.\n2003), and a playback study with Black-capped Chickadees found\nthat birds could discriminate calls of flock mates from those of\nnon-flock mates (Nowicki 1983).\nDistance above ground.—I noted whether a bird was (1) on the\nground or <1 m above ground, (2) 1–5 m above ground, or (3) >5 m\nup when it called. I analyzed this variable because the note types\nof chick-a-dee calls differ in several acoustic parameters, includ-\ning frequency, and lower frequencies of sound can be affected by\nproximity to ground differently than high-frequency sound—for\nexample, because of interference and reverberation (Marten and\nMarler 1977, Wiley and Richards 1982).\nDistance from observer.—When recording, I noted my dis-\ntance from signalers. Birds closer to a human observer may be\nmore alarmed, which may affect vocal production (Morton 1977).\nI noted whether birds were <10 m or >10 m from me.\nFlying behavior.—If a bird produced a chick-a-dee call and\nthen flew within 1 s afterward or produced the call while in flight,\nI noted the call as a “flight” call. Findings from both Smith’s (1972)\nand Gaddis’s (1985) studies suggested that birds may produce dif-\nferent call structures when flying.\nAvian predators.—On rare occasions, Cooper’s Hawks\n(Accipiter cooperii) or Sharp-shinned Hawks (A. striatus) flew\nthrough or near the area where I was recording Carolina Chick-\nadees. On these occasions, I noted the call during which I first\ndetected the hawk and counted the next 30 s of calls as being\ncalls produced in the context of a predator. I chose this 30-s\ntime-frame because it ensured that the hawk was no longer vis-\nible (at least not to the observer) by the end of the period. These\ntwo species are common predators of small songbirds and are\nknown to prey on chickadees (reviewed in Smith 1991), and\ninstances of Sharp-shinned Hawks flying near flocks of Mexican\nChickadees (Ficken 1990) and Black-capped Chickadees (Ficken\nand Witkin 1977) affected the chickadees’ vocal behavior.\nCall analysis and note Classification\nI digitized the recordings from the tapes of the 40 recording\nsites using COOL EDIT PRO, version 2 (Syntrillium Software,\nScottsdale, Arizona). Tapes were digitized at a sample rate of\n22,050 and 16-bit resolution on the Windows XP platform. Notes of\ncalls were classified from the Spectral View window (Blackmann-\nHarris windowing function at a resolution of 256 bands) after\nusing the Butterworth Hi-Pass filter at 1,000 Hz to eliminate\nlow-frequency noise. Note compositions of calls were entered\nmanually into an SPSS spreadsheet (SPSS, Chicago, Illinois).\nNotes were categorized on the basis of note designations\ndescribed recently for this species (Bloomfield et al. 2005; Fig. 1).\nBecause of variation in background noise and distances of birds\ncalling, I could not distinguish Bloomfield et al.’s “B1” and “B2”\nnotes reliably, so I combined them in analyses. This combined\nnote category is called the “E” note type here, to distinguish the\nstructure of these notes from the inverted U-shape of B notes\ndocumented in a number of chickadee species (review in Lucas\nand Freeberg 2007). Finally, one of the note types described by\nBloomfield et al. (2005), the high-tee-chick note, was extremely\nrare in my sample (<0.005 notes call–1) and so was not included\nin the contextual analyses of note types described below.\nstatistical analyses\nIndividual birds were not banded in the present study. Because of\nthis, I used recording site (typically, n = 40) as the unit of analysis.\nGiven the 400-m minimum distance between adjacent recording\nsites, each recording site likely represented a different flock.\nBecause of the non-normal distributions of many of the data sets,\nI used nonparametric tests for all analyses. All statistical tests\nwere conducted using SPSS, version 15.0 for Windows, and all\ntests were two-tailed. For each contextual variable, I determined\nthe average number of each of the note types in calls. For analyses\nof possible associations of calls with time of day and location,\nI used the Kruskal-Wallis analysis of variance (ANOVA) by ranks\nor Mann-Whitney U tests. For analyses of possible associations of\ncalls with distance above ground, distance from observer, flying\nbehavior, and presence of an avian predator, I used either Friedman’s\ntwo-way ANOVA by ranks or Wilcoxon’s signed-ranks test. SPSS\noften converts the various nonparametric statistics into Z scores or\nchi-square statistics, which I report.\nBecause I was testing for context effects in six note types\n(A, E, B, C, Dh, and D), I used a sequential Bonferroni adjustment\n(Rice 1989). Thus, the initial adjusted alpha level in each test was\n0.05/6 = 0.0083. In the results, I report significant differences and\nnote as “trends” cases of P values being <0.05 but greater than the\nadjusted alpha levels.\nThe above-mentioned analyses focused on numbers of note\ntypes individually, which implies that numbers of note types are\nindependent of one another in chick-a-dee calls. Evidence indi-\ncates that presence of certain notes may constrain the numbers\nof other notes, however (e.g., Hailman et al. 1985, Freeberg et al.\n2003), and so a final set of analyses focused on contextual effects\non whole-call note compositions. Calls were categorized by “call\ntype,” which ordered the distinct note type in the call without\nregard to note number. For example, three calls with the note\ncompositions EEECCD, ECDDDDD, and ECCCCCDD would be\ncategorized as the “ECD” call type. Within each contextual vari-\nable, I determined the five most common call types for each of the\nfactors compared and then tested for contextual effects on those\ncall types using the same nonparametric tests indicated above.\nFor each contextual variable, more than five most common call\ntypes went into the analysis, because the five most common call\ntypes of, for example, birds in the flight context (EC, E, ECD, ED,\nand C) were not the same as the five most common call types of\nbirds in the nonflight context (ED, ECD, A, BD, and D). To correct\nfor multiple comparisons in these call-type analyses, I used a\nsequential Bonferroni adjustment for the number of call types\nbeing assessed in each context.\nR esults\noverall note Composition in eastern tennessee\nchick-a-dee Calls\nA trained observer independently scored 412 calls from a random\nsubset of the sound files from 11 of the 40 recording sites to\ndetermine inter-rater reliability on note classification.

As another test of inter-rater reliability, I found\nthat percentage agreement for presence or absence of the different\nnote types across the 412 calls independently scored was also high\n(A notes, 90.5%; E notes, 84.7%; B notes, 89.1%; C notes, 97.8%; Dh\nnotes, 95.4%; D notes, 99.8%).\nAcross the 40 recording sites, 5,591 calls were scored (average:\n140 calls site–1; range: 58–272) and 34,247 notes were classified, for\nan average of 6.13 notes call–1 (range: 1–45). Overall average numbers\nof notes per call are provided in Table 1. Calls of this population\nof Carolina Chickadees typically have roughly two introductory\nnotes (A, E, and B notes), followed by less than one C note, and con-\nclude with roughly three D notes. Because D notes were much more\ncommon in calls than the other note types, they are plotted in dif-\nferent graphs in the figures. High-tee-chick (H) notes and Dh notes\nwere rare in this sample (seen in 0.3% and 4.6% of the calls recorded,\nrespectively).\nAll of the note types were recorded from birds at each of the\n40 recording sites, except for B notes (39 recording sites), Dh notes\n(36 recording sites), and H notes (12 recording sites).

If the note type did occur in a call, it tended to occur\neither only once (B, H, and Dh notes), or else in a string of the same\nnote type (A, E, C, and D notes; Table 1). This suggests that for\nsome note types, receivers may attend primarily to presence or\nabsence of the note in a call, whereas for other note types, receivers\nmay attend primarily or additionally to the number of the note in\na call. There were 20 different call types that occurred in >1% of\nthe total call set, which together accounted for ~93% of the call\ntypes in the total sample (Table 2). There were an additional 100\ncall types, which occurred in <1% of the sample, and 49 of those\nwere recorded only once.\nContextual associations with use of note types in Calls\nTime of day.—I did not detect an association of time of day with\nnote types of chick-a-dee calls, though there was a statistical trend.\nCarolina Chickadees tended to produce calls with a larger num-\nber of C notes in the morning recordings than in the afternoon\nrecordings (Mann-Whitney U test; Z = 2.286, P = 0.022, adjusted\nα = 0.0083). The most common call types in this analysis were\nED, ECD, A, BD, D, EC, E, EBD, and AECD. I did not detect an\nassociation of time of day with call types (largest Z score from\nMann-Whitney test = 1.774, P = 0.076, for the BD type).\nLocation.—Note composition of chick-a-dee calls was asso-\nciated with the location of recording sites (Fig. 2A). A significant\nassociation with location was detected for C notes (Kruskal-Wallis\ntest, χ2 = 9.589, df = 2, P = 0.008, adjusted α = 0.0083). Pairwise\ncomparisons using the Mann-Whitney test revealed that birds\nat the Ijams location had significantly more C notes in their calls\nthan birds at NDSP and UTFRREC. There were trends for an\nassociation of location with number of notes for B notes (χ2 =\n7.580, df = 2, P = 0.023, adjusted α = 0.01) and E notes (χ2 = 6.912,\ndf = 2, P = 0.032).\nThe most common call types in this analysis were ED, ECD, A,\nBD, D, EC, E, EBD, and AECD. There were significant associations of\nlocation with note composition type (Fig. 2B). Location was associ-\nated with the EBD call type (Kruskal-Wallis test, χ2 = 19.279, df = 2,\nP < 0.001, adjusted α = 0.0056) and the BD call type (Kruskal-Wallis\ntest, χ2 = 13.841, df = 2, P = 0.001, adjusted α = 0.0063). Birds at\nUTFRREC used a higher proportion of these call types than birds\nat Ijams and NDSP. Location was also associated with the ED call\ntype (Kruskal-Wallis test, χ2 = 10.290, df = 2, P = 0.006, adjusted\nα = 0.0071). Birds at NDSP used a higher proportion of that call\ntype than birds at Ijams and UTFRREC. There was a tendency for\nlocation to be associated with the EC call type (Kruskal-Wallis\ntest, χ2 = 7.332, df = 2, P = 0.026, adjusted α = 0.0083).\nDistance above ground.—I obtained chick-a-dee calls for all\nthree heights at 27 of the 40 recording sites. Note composition\nof calls was associated with the height above ground of the indi-\nvidual producing the call for D notes (Fig. 3A; Friedman test, χ2 =\n26.741, df = 2, P < 0.001, adjusted α = 0.0083), A notes (Friedman\ntest, χ2 = 15.903, df = 2, P < 0.001, adjusted α = 0.01), and E notes\n(Friedman test, χ2 = 14.15, df = 2, P = 0.001, adjusted α = 0.0125). In\npairwise comparisons using the Wilcoxon signed-ranks test, birds\nproduced more D notes and fewer A and E notes in their calls when\nwithin 1 m of the ground than when 1–5 m above ground, and more\nD notes and fewer A and E notes in their calls at both those heights\nthan when they were >5 m off the ground. There were trends\nfor Dh notes (Friedman test, χ2 = 7.525, df = 2, P = 0.023, adjusted\nα = 0.0167), C notes (Friedman test, χ2 = 6.868, df = 2, P = 0.032),\nand B notes (Friedman test, χ2 = 6.554, df = 2, P = 0.038) to be asso-\nciated with the signaler’s height above ground.\nI compared recording sites in terms of call types from calls\nobtained “low” to the ground (<5 m above ground) and calls obtained\nTable 1.

Structurally, the call is a highly complex signaling\nsystem that, by virtue of its note composition and note ordering\nrules, can theoretically convey an immense amount of informa-\ntion (Hailman et al. 1985). An implication of this idea is that calls\nwith different note compositions represent different messages\n(Lucas and Freeberg 2007). However, few quantitative analyses\nexist to assess whether the note composition of calls produced by\nsignalers is related to the context of the signaler. I tried to address\nthis paucity of quantitative data by recording calls produced by\nsignalers in naturally occurring contexts. The note composition\nof chick-a-dee calls was associated with contextual variables for\nall six of the note types analyzed here. Furthermore, common call\ntypes were associated with contextual variables as well.\nTime of day and distance to observer were not strongly asso-\nciated with either note types or call types. Location was associated\nwith the number of C notes in calls—birds at Ijams had higher\nnumbers of C notes in their calls than birds at the other two study\nlocations. In terms of call types, birds at UTFRREC used more of\nthe EBD and BD call types in their call samples than birds at the\nother two locations, and birds at NDSP used more of the ED call\ntype in their call samples than birds at the other two locations. It\nis possible that these differences in note use are learned micro-\ngeographic markers of those local populations, though controlled\nstudies of vocal development would be needed to test this. Learning\nof note characteristics occurs in chick-a-dee calls of Black-capped\nChickadees (Nowicki 1989, Hughes et al. 1998).\nFig. 4. Associations of distance from observer with note use in calls.

Freeberg — auk , Vol . 125\nWhere a signaler was in relation to the ground had a strong\ninfluence on the note composition of the calls it produced. Birds\non or close to the ground were frequently feeding. When pro-\nduced close to the ground, increased D notes in calls and calls\ncomprising only D notes (the D call type) may, therefore, signal\nground-related foraging (see also Smith 1972). Alternatively, if\nthe structure of D notes is more negatively affected when calls are\nproduced near the ground, increasing the number of notes (and,\ntherefore, the redundancy of the possible message of a D note) may\naid in signal transmission to a receiver (e.g., Hailman et al. 1985).\nCarolina Chickadees in the context of flying produced more\nE and C notes in their calls (and more of the EC call type) than\nthose in baseline, non-flight contexts. This suggests that greater\nuse of these two notes may convey to flock members that the sig-\nnaler is moving—this corroborates earlier findings regarding the\nC notes in Carolina Chickadees (called “chick notes”; Smith 1972)\nand in Mountain Chickadees (called “II-B notes”; Gaddis 1985).\nSmith (1972) also noted that the D call type was often given when\nbirds were perched and was rarely given when birds were flying, a\nresult obtained in the present study.\nWhen an avian predator flew through or near a flock I was\nrecording, the Carolina Chickadees produced more A notes and\nmore of the A call type in their calls (though this should be inter-\npreted cautiously, because avian predators were observed at only 8 of\nthe 40 recording sites). The A notes often have minimal frequency\nmodulation in the calls of Carolina Chickadees. These notes\nappear to be structurally similar to the high see note discussed by\nSmith (1972), the high zee–alarm zee note discussed by Hailman\nand Ficken (1996), and the zi note of Willow Tits (Poecile montanus)\ndiscussed by Haftorn (2000), note types used by birds that have\ndetected a predator. In that these high-frequency notes have\nminimal frequency modulation, they possess the design features\nfor the context of alarm—they are easily detectable, yet difficult\nto locate in space (Marler 1959, Morton 1977).\nIn assessing possible messages and meanings in a communi-\ncation system, researchers frequently take four steps. The first is to\nFig. 5. Associations of flight behavior with note use in calls. (A) Number of notes per call. (B) Percentage of calls with call type. White bars represent\nbaseline, non-flight calls, and dark gray bars represent calls of birds that flew within 1 s after producing the call or that called in flight (n = 33 recording\nsites with both “flight” and “non-flight” calls). Remainder of data plotted as in Figure 2.\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/auk/article/125/4/896/5148299 by University of Maryland College Park user on 13 January 2026ocTober 2008 — conTexT and C hiCk-a - dee call STrucTure — 905\nattempt a description of the system according to the classification\nof units by the researcher. The second is to determine whether\nthe units of the system are used differently in different contexts—\nwhether the units might represent different messages. The third is\nto determine whether the units are perceptible and discriminated\nby the organisms themselves. The fourth is to test whether the\norganisms behaviorally respond to the different units in predict-\nable ways in natural settings. In the present study, I attempted to\naddress the first two steps in uncovering the chick-a-dee call sys-\ntem of this eastern Tennessee population of Carolina Chickadees.\nFirst, the inter-rater reliability seen here for this note-classification\nscheme suggests that these six note types are reliably delineated\nby human observers (a result also obtained by Bloomfield et al.\n2005). Second, all six note types, as well as most of the more com-\nmon call types, were significantly associated with at least one of\nthe contextual variables studied here. However, it is interesting\nto note that there was a considerable lack of contextual specificity\nfor the note types and call types. For example, calls with relatively\ngreater numbers of C notes tended to be produced by birds at the\nIjams location than by birds at the other locations, by birds higher\nabove ground than by birds within 1 m of the ground, and by birds\nin flight than by birds not in flight. This lack of contextual specific-\nity suggests that receivers may additionally need to attend to the\nactual context of signaling (e.g., the direction of the sound, visual\nstimuli related to movement of flock mates, etc.) and the acoustic\nfeatures of the notes themselves to be able to predict signaler state\nand behavior with greater accuracy. Nonetheless, Carolina Chick-\nadees could, theoretically, gain substantial information about a sig-\nnaler from just a small number of the signaler’s calls. For example,\na bird at NDSP, perhaps separated from its flock, that hears a sig-\nnaler produce a number of chick-a-dee calls of the ED call type\nmay perceive the signaler to be a local bird that is not flying and\nthat has not detected a flying avian predator.\nThe note types occurring in chick-a-dee calls of this popu-\nlation of Carolina Chickadees appear to be linked to numerous\ncontextual variables—ranging from environmental factors (local\npopulation, where the signaler is in relation to the ground)\nto behavioral tendencies (flying behavior) to states of changing\nFig. 6.

The quantita-\ntive approach taken here largely corroborates the qualitative\ndescriptions of contextual uses of note types in Smith (1972).\nThese findings lend support to the arguments about the infor-\nmational complexity of the chick-a-dee call system (Hailman\net al. 1985)—quite a large number of messages can conceivably\nbe encoded in the note composition of these calls. In that the\nchick-a-dee call system is shared by many chickadee and related\nspecies that vary considerably in their patterns of social orga-\nnization, this call system represents a potentially rich avenue for\ncomparative work to address possible relationships between social\nand vocal complexity.\nA cknowledgMents\nThis work was conducted under Institutional Animal Care and\nUse Committee protocol no. 1248 (approved 24 February 2003)\nfrom the University of Tennessee.

In\na first experiment, we observed\nthe behavior of the females of a\nhabituated group in response to\nplaybacks of natural call series of\ntheir own male. A female could serve\nas focal subject if she was located\nat the periphery of the group while\nthe male was at the opposite side,\nhereby ensuring that the male’s calls\nemanated from the correct direction.\nPlayback trials consisted of five\n‘hacks’, five ‘pyows’ or a five-call\nP–H sequence. Using a GPS unit, the\nfocal female’s location was marked\nprior to and 20 min after playback,\nwhile her behavior was monitored\ncontinuously.\nOur results showed that playback\nof ‘hack’ series (usually indicating\neagle presence) inhibited movement\nin females (median = 1.0 m) and\nMeaningful call\ncombinations in a\nnon-human primate\nKate Arnold and Klaus Zuberbühler\nHuman speech is based on\nrule-governed assemblage of\nmorphemes into more complex\nvocal expressions. Free- ranging\nputty- nosed monkeys\n(Cercopithecus nictitans) provide\nan interesting analogy, because\nmales combine two loud alarm calls,\n‘hacks’ and ‘pyows’, into different\ncall series depending on external\nevents [1]. Series consisting of\n‘pyows’ are a common response to\nleopards, while ‘hacks’ or ‘hacks’\nfollowed by ‘pyows’ are regularly\ngiven to crowned eagles [2,3].\nSometimes, males produce a further\nsequence, consisting of 1–4 ‘pyows’\nfollowed by 1–4 ‘hacks’. These\n‘pyow–hack’ (P–H) sequences can\noccur alone, or they are inserted\nat or near the beginning of another\ncall series. Regardless of context,\nP–H sequences reliably predict\nforthcoming group progression [4].\nIn playback experiments, we tested\nthe monkeys’ reactions to ‘pyows’,\n‘hacks’ and P–H sequences and\nfound that responses matched the\nnatural conditions. Specifically,\nfemales started group progressions\nafter hearing P–H sequences and\nresponded appropriately to the other\ncall series. In a second experiment,\nwe tested artificially composed P–H\nsequences, and found that they\nwere also effective in eliciting group\nprogressions. In a third experiment,\nwe established that group movement\ncould only be triggered by the calls\nof the group’s own male, not those\nof a stranger. We conclude that, in\nthis primate, meaning is encoded by\ncall sequences, not individual calls.\nMany birds and primates are limited\nby small vocal repertoires [5,6], and\nthis constraint may have favored\nthe evolution of such combinatorial\nsignaling.\nWe designed playback\nexperiments to investigate whether\nP–H sequences given by a male are\ncausally responsible for eliciting\nCorrespondence A\nSynth P-HP-HHacksPyows\n60\n50\n40\n30\n20\n10\n0\nMedian distance traveled (m)\nB\nSynth P-HP-HHacksPyows\n12\n10\n8\n6\n4\n2\n0\nMedian latency to travel (min)\nCurrent Biology\nFigure 1.

Playback of ‘pyows’\n(indicating a range of disturbances,\nincluding leopard presence)\nelicited relatively rapid responses\n(median = 1.1 min), although the\ndistance traveled towards the\nspeaker was small (median = 4.0 m).\nMovement was often accompanied\nby scanning behavior in the direction\nof the calls, as if trying to acquire\nadditional information about the\ncause, a pattern also seen to natural\n‘pyows’. P–H sequences resulted\nin significant travel towards the\ncalls (median = 32.0 m), although\nfemales only responded slowly\n(median = 8.1 min). Statistically,\nboth travel distance and latencies\ndiffered significantly across the three\nconditions (Figure 1A: n H = n P =\nn P – H = 5, d.f. = 2, χ2 = 8.4, p = 0.008;\nFigure 1B: n H = n P = n P – H = 5, d.f. = 2,\nχ2 = 7.6, p = 0.024, Friedman tests,\ntwo-tailed; see Supplemental data\nfor individual responses, post-hoc\nanalyses, and comparisons with\nnatural responses).\nAt this point, it could be argued\nthat there were subtle acoustic\ndifferences between ‘pyows’\nand ‘hacks’ produced as part of\nP–H sequences compared to calls\ngiven in response to predators,\nand that listeners responded to\nthese differences, rather than call\ncombinations. Although acoustic\nanalyses did not support this\nhypothesis (see the Supplemental\ndata available on-line with this\nissue) we carried out a second\nexperiment, this time using artificially\ncomposed P–H sequences edited\nfrom ‘pyows’ and ‘hacks’ originally\ngiven to predator stimuli. We found\nno differences between artificial\nand natural P–H sequences in the\ndistance traveled by females and\ntheir response latencies (P–H real\nmedian = 32.0 m, P–H synthesised\nmedian = 21.0 m: Wilcoxon signed\nranks test, n 1 = n 2 = 5, z = –1.483,\np = 0.188; P–H real median = 8.1 min,\nP–H synthesised median = 4.1 min:\nWilcoxon signed ranks test,\nn 1 = n 2 = 5, z = –1.214, p = 0.313;\nFigure 1). We concluded that the\ncommunicatively salient property of\nthe signal was how calls were\nassembled, rather than any contextspecific acoustic variation within\n‘pyows’ or ‘hacks’.\nIn a final experiment, we\ninvestigated whether females\ndiscriminated between calls given\nby their own male compared to other\nmales of the same population. At our\nstudy site, monkey groups are often\nsurrounded by neighbors, suggesting\nthat females should be selective\nin their responses when hearing\nmale calls, particularly to P– H\nsequences. We repeated the first\nexperiment, this time testing various\nunhabituated groups within a 32 km 2\nstudy area. In response to ‘pyows’\nand P–H sequences some females\ntraveled towards the speaker\n(35.5%, 29.4% of trials, respectively)\nbut never in response to ‘hacks’\n(0.0%). However, approaches were\nonly observed in a small number of\nfemales (median = 2.0) and only in\nassociation with their own male. All\nremaining group members stayed\nbehind regardless of stimulus type,\nso that the median travel\ndistances to all stimuli were\nnegligible (median = 0.0 m in all\nconditions; Kruskal-Wallis, n 1 = 16,\nn 2 = n 3 = 17, d.f. = 2, χ2 = 5.177,\np = 0.075; Figure 2), confirming that\nfemales discriminated between call\nsequences by their own and those\nof stranger males, especially in\nresponse to P–H sequences.\nOur study has demonstrated\nthat putty-nosed monkey call\ncombinations convey at least\nthree types of information: the\nevent witnessed by the male, the\ncaller’s identity, and whether he\nintends to travel, all of which are\nrecognized by other monkeys. We\nconclude that, contrary to current\ntheory, meaningful combinatorial\nsignals have evolved in primate\ncommunication [7–9] and future\nwork may reveal further examples.\nMany forest primates and most\nbird species are limited by small\nvocal repertoires [5,10], and this\nconstraint may have favored the\nevolution of combinatorial signals.\nThe exact psychological mechanism\nof how the observed semantic\nchanges are achieved when two\ncall types interact in a sequence,\nhowever, is a matter for further\ninvestigation.\nAcknowledgments\nWe thank the Nigerian National Parks Service,\nthe Nigerian Conservation Foundation,\nV.

Mahurina and Todd M. Freeberga,b\na\nDepartment of Psychology and b\nDepartment of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, University of\nTennessee, Knoxville, TN 37996, USA\nThe ‘‘chick-a-dee’’ call of many Paridae species (titmice, tits, and chickadees) is structurally complex and functions in social\ncohesion. Studies with different Parid species suggest that variation in the note composition of calls relates to a wide variety of\ncontexts. An earlier study with Carolina chickadees (Poecile carolinensis), the focal species of the present study, found that receivers\nresponded differently to playback calls differing in note composition in feeding contexts. Here, we addressed whether signalers\nactually produce calls differing in note composition in feeding contexts and whether those calls might serve a recruitment\nfunction. In a first study, we found that the first chickadee to take seed from a feeding station produced calls with a greater\nnumber of D notes before the second chickadee arrived to take seed, compared with after the second chickadee arrived to take\nseed. This suggests that calls with a large number of D notes might serve a general recruitment function. We tested this idea in\na second study, using playbacks of calls containing a large number of D notes or a small number of D notes at different sites. We\nfound that the latency for a first chickadee to come into a site and take seed was shorter for playback variants containing a large\nnumber of D notes. Thus, in Carolina chickadees, chick-a-dee calls containing a large number of D notes may function to recruit\nother flock members to a discovered food source. Key words: Carolina chickadee, chick-a-dee calls, foraging, recruitment, vocalizations. [Behav Ecol 20:111–116 (2009)]\nINTRODUCTION\nA major benefit of living in a social group is an increased\nability to detect and exploit food resources (Wilson\n1975; Krause and Ruxton 2002). This ability is facilitated by\nvocal signaling in many species (Hauser 1996; Bradbury and\nVehrencamp 1998). Communication about food presence\nwith vocalizations has been documented in several taxa, including bats, cetaceans, primates, and birds (e.g., Elgar 1986;\nHeinrich 1988; Chapman and Lefebvre 1990; Hauser et al.\n1993; Caine et al. 1995; Wilkinson and Boughman 1998; Evans\nand Evans 1999; Janik 2000; Di Bitetti 2005).\nIn black-capped chickadees, Poecile atricapillus, individuals\nfinding a food source often produce chick-a-dee calls (Ficken\n1981), which may function to recruit flock members. The\nchick-a-dee call of the avian subgenus Poecile is structurally\ncomplex and is produced in a variety of contexts related to\nsocial cohesiveness and interaction (Smith 1972; Ficken et al.\n1978; Hailman et al. 1985; Hailman 1989; Smith 1991; Lucas\nand Freeberg 2007). The most extensive work on chick-a-dee\ncall structure has been conducted with black-capped chickadees. The call in this species is composed of a small number of\ndistinct note types that may be produced a varied number of\ntimes within any given call and that follow note ordering rules\n(Hailman et al. 1985, 1987; Charrier et al. 2004). The chicka-dee call in Carolina chickadees, P. carolinensis, the focal\nspecies of the current study, is structurally similar to that of\nblack-capped chickadees but appears to have a larger number\nof distinct note types (Bloomfield et al. 2005; Figure 1).\nIt has been suggested that chick-a-dee calls differing in note\ncomposition could convey different messages (Hailman et al.\n1985; Hailman and Ficken 1986), but there has been little\nplayback work to test this hypothesis. Templeton et al.\n(2005) found that captive black-capped chickadees produced\ncalls with a greater number of D notes when they detected\nsmaller and more threatening avian predators than when they\ndetected larger and less threatening predators. In addition,\nplaybacks of chick-a-dee calls varying in note composition produced mobbing-like behavior in receivers that was predictive\nof predator size. Freeberg and Lucas (2002) found that Carolina chickadees were more likely to come into feeding stations and take seed with playback calls that had a relatively\nlarge number of C notes compared with playback calls that\nhad no C notes and a relatively large number of D notes. The\nFreeberg and Lucas (2002) study, however, did not distinguish\ncalling during initial food detection from subsequent calling\nwith regard to the number of C and D notes. In her seminal\nmonograph on the vocal behavior of Carolina chickadees,\nSmith (1972, pp. 50–51) suggested that both C and D note\nusages may increase in the context of signalers flying to and\ndeparting from feeding stations when taking food from those\nstations. Thus, it is still rather an open question as to whether\nC notes or D notes, or perhaps both, might function in general recruitment or in recruitment specifically related to predator or food detection in chickadees.\nWe conducted 2 studies to determine whether Carolina\nchickadees produce calls varying in C and D note composition\nwhen first detecting and exploiting a food source and, if so, if\nplaybacks of calls varying in such note composition might serve\nto recruit other chickadees. In our first study, we recorded colormarked individuals at several field sites to determine whether\nthe first chickadee to obtain seed from a feeding station produced calls with different note composition prior to a second\nchickadee taking seed from that feeding station, compared with\nafter the second chickadee took seed from the feeding station.\nIn our second study, we played back chick-a-dee calls that varied\nin note composition (based on results of the first study) to\ntest whether calls differing in note composition might affect\nthe latencies of receivers to take seed from feeding stations.\nAddress correspondence to T.M.

First, D notes should\noccur less often in calls produced in food-related contexts if\nlarger numbers of D notes are related to antipredator mobbing\nbehavior (Templeton et al. 2005). However, D notes should\noccur more often in calls of a signaler that has detected a food\nsource if these notes serve a more general recruitment function than solely predator mobbing. Second, C notes should be\nproduced in greater numbers in calls in the context of discovering a food source if larger numbers of C notes are associated\nwith food presence (as in Freeberg and Lucas 2002). However,\nif C notes are related more to the flight behavior of the signaler, as suggested by other studies (e.g., Smith 1972; Freeberg forthcoming) or to the detection of predators (e.g.,\nFicken et al. 1994), then usage of C notes may not be affected\nby initial contact with a food source.\nMETHODS\nStudy 1. Do birds vary note composition of calls when they\ndetect food?\nStudy location\nWe recorded Carolina chickadees at the University of Tennessee Forest Resources, Research, and Education Center (36 N\n00, 84 W 13). Recordings took place at these sites in the context\nof feeding stations, each made of a wooden board (25 cm 3 40\ncm 3 2 cm) mounted atop a steel pole (1.8 m tall); when the\npole was set in the ground, the board was roughly 1.5 m\nhigh. Each site was stocked every 10–14 days during the late\nfall and winter months with approximately 100 g of an equal\namount of black oil sunflower and safflower seed to get\nthe birds accustomed to the feeding stations as an irregular\nfood source.\nRecordings\nBirds were recorded between 07:45 and 12:30 Eastern Standard\nTime in late winter and early spring months. After the observer\narrived at a site and set up the recording equipment, the feeding station was stocked with roughly 50 g of a 1:1 mix of sunflower and safflower seed. The observer sat partially concealed\nbehind vegetation or behind a camouflage fence blind 10 m\nfrom the feeding station and waited for chickadees to approach. Recording commenced when a Carolina chickadee\nfirst approached within 20 m of the feeding station, so that\nwe could obtain the first calls produced by the first chickadees\nto arrive at the food source. We were interested in assessing the\nchick-a-dee calls produced by the first bird to take seed from\na feeding station in 2 contexts. The first context involved calls\nproduced before a second chickadee arrived to take seed from\nthat feeding station. The second context involved calls produced after that second chickadee had arrived to take seed\nfrom that feeding station. We hypothesized that a certain note\ntype may serve a recruitment function in chick-a-dee calls, if, on\naverage, relatively greater numbers of that note type were produced by the first bird discovering and exploiting a food source\nprior to the second bird arriving and taking seed. If a chickadee\ndid not approach within 20 m of the feeding station within\n90 min of the observer first setting up, the session was abandoned and the seed was left on the stand.\nWe recorded 12 different birds between February and April\nin 3 different years (3 chickadees in 2006, 6 in 2007, 3 in 2008);\n11 were color-marked individuals and 1 was unbanded but had\ndistinctive white feathers on its head. This February–April recording window spans the period in which overwintering flocks\nbreak up into breeding pairs. Some of our February and early\nMarch recordings involved instances of more than one chickadee coming in to the feeding station after the first bird had\narrived to take seed, whereas our later March and April recordings involved only one other individual (likely the mate) coming in after the first bird had arrived to take seed. Many other\nindividuals were recorded during our data collection, but only\nthese 12 individuals fit our criteria for inclusion in this study:\n(1) being individually identifiable, (2) being the first bird to\ntake seed from a feeding station after we stocked it, and (3)\nproducing chick-a-dee calls both before and after a second\nchickadee arrived at the feeding station to take seed. We\nrecorded calls of birds using Marantz PMD-222 cassette recorders with Maxell XL-II high-bias tape, or Fostex FR-2 digital field\nrecorders (with sample rate of 22 050 and 16-bit resolution),\nand Sennheiser ME-62 microphones. Observers called out\nthe locations, behavior, and color band markings of birds onto\nthe tape or sound file.\nCall analysis\nTapes were digitized using Cool Edit Pro 2.0 (Syntrillium Software) at a sample rate of 22 050 and 16-bit resolution. Note\ncomposition of calls was analyzed using the Spectral View window (Blackmann-Harris window function at 256-band resolution) based on published note classifications for Carolina\nchickadees (Bloomfield et al. 2005). The number of each note\ntype in each call was manually entered into an SPSS spreadsheet. We focused on numbers of notes in these studies because of the earlier suggestion that calls with different note\ncompositions convey different messages to receivers (e.g.,\nHailman et al. 1985). We scored 3 note categories in the\npresent study (Figure 1). ‘‘C notes’’ are structurally complex\nnotes that generally increase in frequency over the course of\nthe note and span a large frequency range. ‘‘D notes’’ are\nbroadband, with a characteristic harmonic-like structure,\nFigure 1\nSound spectrograms of the chick-a-dee calls used in the playback\nstudy. Spectrograms were generated using Avisoft SASLab Pro\n(Blackman window with Fast Fourier Transform length of 1024,\nframe size 75%, and 47-Hz frequency resolution). The text above\neach spectrogram indicates note composition/bird identification/\nand order of playback. For note composition, ‘‘In.’’ ¼ Introductory\nnote, ‘‘C’’ ¼ C note, and ‘‘D’’ ¼ D note. The ticks on the y axes mark\n5-kHz intervals, and the ticks on the x axes mark 0.5-s intervals.\n112 Behavioral Ecology\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/beheco/article/20/1/111/214096 by University of Maryland College Park user on 13 January 2026and typically have little frequency modulation. ‘‘Introductory\nnotes’’ comprised all the additional note types of Bloomfield\net al. (2005) except for their D h note, which only occurred\nonce in this study, and was included in the D note category.\nWe determined the number of Introductory, C, and D notes\nin each call. E.J.M. scored all the recorded calls of the 12 birds\nfor note composition, blind to whether the calls were produced\nbefore or after the second chickadee arrived to take a seed.\nT.M.F. independently scored the notes of each of the calls,\nand interrater agreement was high (Cohen’s kappas: Introductory ¼ 0.930; C ¼ 0.927; and D ¼ 0.977; E.J.M.’s note scoring\ndata went into subsequent analyses). Calls were analyzed for\nthe average numbers per call of these 3 note classes produced\nby the first bird to take seed both prior to and subsequent to\nthe second bird taking seed, using Wilcoxon signed-ranks tests\n(SPSS 15.0; SPSS converts the signed-ranks test statistics into Z\nscores, which are reported below). We adjusted the alpha level\nto 0.017 in analyses of note composition of calls to correct for\n3 comparisons in each test (Introductory, C, D notes), and\ntests were 2-tailed.\nStudy 2. Do calls with more D notes recruit receivers to take\nseed?\nStudy location\nWe played back calls to flocks of Carolina chickadees at the\nUniversity of Tennessee Forest Resources, Research, and Education Center from 5th to 22nd March 2008. Playbacks were\ncarried out at 12 different sites near feeding stations (materials\nand dimensions of feeding stations described above). Each site\nwas at least 400 m from the closest adjacent site to ensure independence of sites (data from field studies in the winter of\n2007–2008 indicate that 58 of 60 [96%] uniquely color-marked\nbirds at 15 different sites separated by this distance were\nrecorded at only one site).\nPlayback calls\nCalls used in the playback study were recorded from 7 different\nbirds (6 were color-marked and 1 was unbanded) in field settings.\nA Sennheiser ME-66 microphone was mounted atop a microphone stand (1 m high) placed within 1 m of the feeding station\nto record calls, using a Fostex FR-2 digital field memory recorder\nwith a sample rate of 48 000 and 16-bit resolution. All playback\ncalls were recorded from birds on or within 1 m of a feeding station, when the bird was 0.5–2 m from the microphone.\nThere were 12 calls used for playbacks, and these were chosen on the basis of quality (primarily, the signaler facing the\nmicrophone when it called, and low background noise) and\nnote composition. Because the first study suggested that an increased number of D notes in calls may serve a recruitment\nfunction (see below), we used 2 sets of calls that varied in\nthe number of D notes (Figure 1). One set of 6 playback calls\nhad a relatively small number of D notes (range ¼ 2–5). This\nrange of D notes was chosen because it spans the typical number of D notes in calls of this population (an average of 3.4 6\n3.7 SD D notes per call; Freeberg forthcoming). The other set\nof 6 playback calls had a relatively large number of D notes\n(range ¼ 7–11). This range of D notes was chosen as it represents roughly twice the number of D notes used in the first\nplayback set and also is in the upper range of D notes produced in the calls of the first birds to exploit seed at a feeding\nstation seen in Study 1 (see below and Figure 2). To try to\navoid the possibility of individual differences (such as sex, age,\nor dominance status) confounding any effect of the number\nof D notes in calls being played back, 4 of the individuals from\nwhich recorded calls were used had both a ‘‘few D call’’ and\na ‘‘many D call’’ in the playback sets (birds 3, 4, 6, and 7 in the\nrows of Figure 1). Each playback call was copied into its own\n60-s sound file such that it was repeated once every 10 s,\nfollowed by silence (e.g., a 1.1-s duration call would be followed by 8.9 s of silence and that 10-s call-silent interval would\nbe repeated 6 times).\nPlayback procedure\nA playback speaker (Cambridge Soundworks, Newton, MA)\nwas set on a 2-m stand positioned 2–3 m from, and facing,\nthe feeding station. At the beginning of a playback at a particular site, after the equipment was set up, the feeding station was\nstocked with roughly 50 g of a 1:1 mix of sunflower and safflower seed. Calls were played back from a laptop PC by the\nobserver sitting behind a camouflage fence blind, 10 m away\nfrom the feeding station. The flocks to which, and sites at\nwhich, calls were played back did not contain the bird that originally produced the call being played back (as in Freeberg and\nLucas 2002). Only one call exemplar was played back at each\nsite. Each call was played back at 75–76 dB sound pressure\nlevel measured at 1 m from the playback speaker using a General Radio (Concord, MA) 1565-B Sound Level Meter with A\nweighting and fast response. For each site, the 60-s sound file\n(containing the exemplar for that site played once every 10 s)\nwas played back at the start of each 5-min playback block,\nfollowed by 4 min of no playback, and there were 12 5-min\nplayback blocks. At the onset of the first playback block, a digital timer was started. The dependent measure was the latency\nfor a first chickadee to come into the feeding station and take\na seed. If no bird took a seed by the end of the 12th playback\nblock (i.e., at 60 min), no more playbacks were conducted,\nbut the timer was run an additional 10 min. Thus, if no bird\ntook a seed at a site, that playback call was given a latency of 70\nmin. Because of the distributions in the latency data, we tested\nfor an effect of playback call using the 2-tailed Wilcoxon test.\nRESULTS\nDo birds vary note composition of calls when they detect\nfood?\nOne hundred and eighty-three calls were obtained from the 12\nbirds that were the first to arrive and take seed (before the\nFigure 2\nThe average number of notes per call produced by the 12 chickadees\nthat were the first to arrive to take seed at a feeding station and\nproduce calls before the second chickadee arrived to take seed (gray\nboxes), and after the second chickadee arrived to take seed (white\nboxes). Data are plotted as medians (thick horizontal line), 25 and\n75 percentiles (boxes), ranges representing nonoutliers (whiskers),\nand outliers (circles).\nMahurin and Freeberg • Chick-a-dee calls and recruitment 113\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/beheco/article/20/1/111/214096 by University of Maryland College Park user on 13 January 2026second bird arrived to take seed: average calls/bird ¼ 7.8,\nrange ¼ 2–24; after the second bird arrived to take seed: average calls/bird ¼ 7.4, range ¼ 1–37). More D notes (average\nnumbers per call for each bird) were produced in the calls\nof the first bird to arrive and exploit food at the feeding station\nbefore the second bird arrived, compared with after the second\nbird arrived (Z ¼ 2.934, N ¼ 12, P ¼ 0.003; Figure 2). For\nIntroductory and C note categories, there were no significant\ndifferences between average numbers of notes produced in\nthe calls of the first bird to arrive and exploit food at the\nfeeding station before the second bird arrived, compared with\nafter the second bird arrived (Introductory notes: Z ¼ 0.533,\nN ¼ 12, P ¼ 0.594; C notes: Z ¼ 0.338, N ¼ 12, P ¼ 0.735;\nFigure 2). Averaging across the 12 birds, chick-a-dee calls of\nthe first individual to take seed from the feeding station contained a mean of 7.0 total notes (61.8 standard deviation\n[SD]) before the second bird arrived to take seed compared\nwith a mean of 4.2 total notes (61.2 SD) after the second bird\narrived to take seed (Z ¼ 3.059, N ¼ 12, P ¼ 0.002).\nDo calls with more D notes recruit receivers to take seed?\nCarolina chickadees were observed to come within 10 m of the\nplayback speaker and feeding station at 9 of the 12 sites (4 sites\nwith playback calls containing few D notes and 5 sites with\nplayback calls containing many D notes). Carolina chickadees\ncame in and took seed from the feeding stations at 7 of the\n12 sites (2 sites with playback calls containing few D notes\nand 5 sites with playback calls containing many D notes).\nThe latency for birds to take seed was significantly shorter\nfor sites in which the playback calls contained many D\nnotes compared with sites with calls containing few D notes\n(2-tailed Wilcoxon test; Wx ¼ 26, m ¼ 6, n ¼ 6, P ¼ 0.031;\nFigure 3).\nDISCUSSION\nCarolina chickadees, like many Parid species, form territorial\noverwintering flocks of unrelated individuals (Ekman 1989;\nMostrom et al. 2002). Because individuals are often out of\nvisual contact as they move through their territory, vocal signaling serves a fundamental communicative role in these species. One of the most commonly used vocal signaling systems\nin chickadees is the chick-a-dee call (Smith 1972). To our\nknowledge, Ficken (1981) was the first to argue explicitly that\nthe call may function in reciprocal altruism within flocks, in\nthat individuals produced chick-a-dee calls when they detected a new food source, and production of these calls could\naid in recruiting flockmates to the food source. Our findings\nindicate that signalers can vary the note composition of their\nchick-a-dee calls on detecting a food source, producing calls\ncontaining more D notes, and this call variation may impact\nwhether and how quickly individuals are recruited to the area.\nWe cannot rule out the possibility that acoustic characteristics\nof D notes, rather than the number of D notes per se, influenced the behavior of receivers. Acoustic parameters of D\nnotes can change depending on how many D notes occur in\na call (Freeberg et al. 2003). Future studies could control this\npotential confound by artificially constructing playback calls\nfrom the same underlying set of D notes that either contained\na large or a small number of those notes.\nOur results with Carolina chickadees suggest that large numbers of D notes in calls can serve a general communicative function related to recruitment to the location of a signaler. This\nconclusion contrasts with the results or interpretations of several other studies comparing note composition of chick-a-dee\ncalls to possible functions. For example, Templeton et al.\n(2005), in a study of black-capped chickadees, suggested that\nlarger numbers of D notes in calls serve a mobbing function in\nthe context of avian predators. Templeton et al. (2005) found\nthat calls with greater numbers of D notes were used in contexts of greater threat (smaller, more agile avian predators)\nthan were calls with fewer numbers of D notes. We note that\npredator stimuli have been linked to D notes in a recent field\nstudy of Carolina chickadees by Nolen and Lucas (forthcoming), to introductory notes in a captive study of black-capped\nchickadees by Baker and Becker (2002), and to C notes in\na field study of Mexican chickadees by Ficken et al. (1994).\nWhether these differences in findings from these several studies stem from real species (or population) differences, differences in interpretation, or differences in methodology,\ncannot be resolved at this point. However, we would argue\nthat these differences indicate that the ‘‘meaning’’ of D notes\n(or, for that matter, any of the note types) is still largely an\nopen question in Parid species.\nWe did not find that C notes were produced more in calls of\nbirds when they first detected and exploited a food source.\nThis would seem to counter the findings of an earlier study\nwith a different population of this species, which indicated that\nbirds were more likely to take seed from feeding stations when\ncalls were played back containing large numbers of C notes,\ncompared with playbacks without C notes (Freeberg and\nLucas 2002). Increased production of C notes in chick-a-dee\ncalls has been associated with flight behavior in Carolina\nchickadees in 2 different studies (Smith 1972; Freeberg forthcoming). This association between increased usage of C notes\nin calls and flight behavior offers another interpretation of\nthe earlier findings of Freeberg and Lucas (2002). That playback study suggested that greater numbers of C notes might\nbe associated with food in Carolina chickadees. The design of\nthat experiment was based on a preliminary study of a small\nnumber of calls recorded from birds contacting a feeding\nstation for the first time. Flight behavior of the birds producing those calls was not noted, but given the microphone orientation with which those calls were recorded, it is likely that\nFigure 3\nThe latency (in minutes) to take seed of chickadees responding to\nplaybacks of calls containing relatively few D notes (white box)\ncompared with chickadees responding to playbacks of calls\ncontaining many D notes (gray box). Data are plotted as medians\n(thick horizontal line), 25 and 75 percentiles (boxes), ranges\nrepresenting nonoutliers (whiskers), and outliers (circles).\n114 Behavioral Ecology\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/beheco/article/20/1/111/214096 by University of Maryland College Park user on 13 January 2026the calls were produced by birds arriving at, on, or departing\nfrom, the seed stand. Thus, the ‘‘C-rich’’ calls described in\nFreeberg and Lucas (2002) may not have been associated with\nfood per se but rather with signaler flight behavior to and\nfrom a platform on which birds perch, which happened to\ncontain seed. On the other hand, if this were true, it is less\nclear why playbacks of calls containing a large number of\nC notes would be more effective at bringing receivers into\na feeding station to take seed, compared with calls containing\nno C notes and a larger number of D notes. This raises the\nexciting possibility that the Indiana population of the earlier\nstudy and the Tennessee population of this study might be\nusing different note compositions in their chick-a-dee calls\nto signal food detection. If so, these population differences\nwould indicate geographic variation in note composition\n(syntax) and call meaning. A direct test of this possibility\nwould be to conduct parallel sets of recordings and playbacks\nat feeding stations, using the same methodologies, to birds of\nboth populations.\nD notes may be the most effective note type at recruiting\nflockmates to the location of a signaler, in that, like C notes,\nthey are broadband, but unlike C notes, D notes are long in\nduration and have most of their energy at lower frequencies\n(Bloomfield et al. 2005). Furthermore, D notes may have\ngreater and more rapid amplitude change at the onset of\nthe note, compared with C notes. All these factors could aid\nin signaler localizability in medium-range signaling (Wiley\nand Richards 1982; Bradbury and Vehrencamp 1998). At the\nlevel of the call as a whole, a call with many D notes would\nhave a longer duration than a call with few D notes, which\ncould contribute to a higher duty cycle, and may therefore be\nmore effectively detected by a receiver. Receivers—in chickadees, primarily flockmates—may be able to exploit this information gained from the signal and from the signaler’s context\n(Leger 1993; see also discussion of fine-level local enhancement in stable groups by Po ̈ysa ̈ 1992).\nTo conclude, these results indicate that note composition of\nchick-a-dee calls is associated with the behavior of the signaler\nin contexts related to detection of food. The first chickadee to\narrive at a new food source may experience increased arousal\nand conflicting motivations to feed or to leave and rejoin the\nflock. Increased arousal or changes in motivation might influence the note composition of chick-a-dee calls it produced. An\nindividual chickadee experiencing greater arousal, minimal to\nmoderate levels of fear, or tendencies toward aggression might\nbe predicted to produce more D notes, in that they are relatively low-frequency notes that can have a ‘‘harsh’’ acoustic\nquality to them, according to motivation-structural rules (Morton 1977; Owings and Morton 1998). Receivers, on hearing\ncalls with large numbers of D notes, may be recruited to the\narea of the signaler, at which time contextual factors (e.g.,\npresence of food or a perched predator) may further influence receiver behavior. The chick-a-dee call offers a strong\nsystem for addressing questions of communicative signal\nstructure and function, in that it is a highly flexible signaling\nsystem and possesses some of the structural characteristics of\nhuman language (Hailman et al. 1985). Our work adds to an\nunderstanding of the structural and functional complexities\nof the chick-a-dee vocal system and points to the need for\nmore intra- and interspecific comparative work.\nThanks to Richard Evans and the staff of the University of Tennessee\nForest Resources, Research, and Education Center.

To explore this hypothesis we\nexamined intra- and interindividual acoustic variation in chatter calls of tree shrews (Tupaia belangeri).\nThe calls were induced experimentally by a disturbance paradigm and related to two defined arousal\nstates of a subject. The arousal state of an animal was primarily operationalised by the habituation of\nthe subject to a new environment and additionally determined by behavioural indicators of stress in\ntree shrews (tail-position and piloerection). We investigated whether the arousal state and indexical\nfeatures of the caller, namely individual identity and sex, are conveyed acoustically. Frame-by-frame\nvideographic and multiparametric sound analyses revealed that arousal and identity, but not sex of a\ncaller reliably predicted spectral–temporal variation in sound structure. Furthermore, there was no effect\nof age or body weight on individual-specific acoustic features. Similar results in another call type of\ntree shrews and comparable findings in other mammalian lineages provide evidence that comparable\nphysiological and morphological constraints in the production of airborne vocalisations across mammals\nlead to commonalities in acoustic features conveying arousal and identity, respectively.\n© 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Introduction\nHuman speech does not only convey linguistic, but also paralinguistic information, such as about speaker identity, age, sex, body\nsize and affective state (e.g. [1]). These paralinguistic prosodic features refer to specific characteristics in voice quality, vocal pitch\ncontour and rhythm (e.g. [2]). Comparative studies on the acoustics of affective prosody in human speech have shown remarkable\ncross-cultural similarities [3–7]. The fact that the same prelinguistic properties of human speech are present across different cultures\nand languages, gives support for the hypothesis that the affective\nprosody of speech may have originated from a prehuman basis and\nthus has very deep-reaching phylogenetic roots.\nMammalian vocal production is based on a rather conservative tetrapod vocal production system composed of lungs, larynx\nand vocal tract [8]. According to the functioning of the basic\nmammalian vocal production system, sender-related physiological and morphological constraints may reliably affect acoustic\nfeatures of vocalisations and thus cause predictable variation\nin communication calls [9–12]. These sender-related constraints\nmay in turn be invariably linked to specific attributes of the\n∗ Corresponding author.

Thus, across mammalian species, comparable morphological [9,10,13,18] and physiological [14] constraints\nin the production of airborne vocalisations are suggested to\nlead to commonalities in acoustic features conveying specific\nattributes of callers. In humans, recent studies on affective\nprosody have shown that spectral–temporal variation in speech\nis strongly associated with the caller’s psychophysiological level\nof arousal—also called affect intensity [19–21]. In non-human\nmammals comparable arousal-related acoustic features within\ncall types do also exist. Call contexts thereby cover predation\n[22–25], disturbance [26] and several social situations such as agonistic interactions [27], courtship [28] group movements [17,29],\nmother–infant interactions [17,30,31], dominant–subdominant\nencounters [32] or foraging situations [33]. Our own study on\ntree shrews (Tupaia belangeri) revealed intra-individual arousalrelated acoustic variation in communication calls (squeaks) uttered\nduring social conflicts [34]. Empirical studies across several\nmammalian species [17,22–27,30,32,33,35–38], including humans\n[19–21,39–41], revealed comparable acoustic features associated\nwith changes in arousal and suggest that sender-related physiological constraints might lead to commonalities across mammals\nin acoustic features conveying arousal.\nIn addition to intra-individual acoustic variation that is related\nto more transient physiological changes of the caller, vocalisations\n0166-4328/$ – see front matter © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Zimmermann / Behavioural Brain Research 203 (2009) 223–231\nmay also vary consistently among different individuals or sexes.\nInter-individual variation in the acoustic structure of communication calls is a pre-requisite for individual recognition, which\nis common in mammals [42,43] and can be found in a variety\nof taxa including human- and non-human primates [36,44–46],\nmarine mammals [47,48], and carnivores [49–51]. Also, sex differences in the acoustic structure of communication calls, which\nare often linked to differences in body size between males and\nfemales, are common among mammals (e.g. for human- and nonhuman primates [10,11,15,44,52,53], rodentia [54], artiodactyla\n[55]). According to Fant’s source-filter theory of speech production [56], these findings suggest that a set of comparable acoustic\nfeatures may convey indexical attributes of callers.\nTo explore potential commonalities in acoustic features to\narousal and indexical attributes across mammals, it is important\nto study various mammalian taxa with distinct degrees of sociality\nand to cover different call types and calling contexts. Tree shrews\nare an interesting study model as they pose a link between primates\nand non-primate mammals [57]. Recent molecular studies have\nrevealed that tree shrews, order Scandentia, are a sister group of primates and flying lemurs, which together form the clade Euarchonta\n[58]. Following Janeˇcka et al. [57] the origin of Scandentia is estimated at ∼86.2 My ago. Tree shrews live in dense vegetation in the\ntropical forest of Southeast Asia. They have an elaborate vocal repertoire, which consists of at least 8 different call types [59]. Laboratory\nand field studies suggest that they usually live in monogamous pairs\nand mates have overlapping territories [60–63]. Each sex defends\na common territory against same-sex conspecifics. Tree shrews are\na well-established model for stress and depression-linked research\n[62,64–66]. They are known to respond to specific stress stimuli\nwith a high inter-individual variation [67]. The general physiological activation of the nervous system leads in tree shrews to defined\nchanges in behavioural displays. When a tree shrew is stressed, it\nraises its tail/ruffles its tail hair [62,65] and may utter disturbance\ncalls named chatter [59]. These calls were also observed in their\nnatural habitat when tree shrews are confronted with predators or\nnew environmental stimuli [60].\nWe examined acoustic features expressing arousal and indexical\nattributes in disturbance calls of tree shrews with a multiparametric sound analysis. The determination of the arousal state of the\nanimals was done independently of their vocal behaviour with a\nframe-by-frame video analysis. We expected predictable acoustic\nvariation in the spectral–temporal structure of chatter calls in relation to the arousal state of the caller. Furthermore, we hypothesised\nthat tree shrews convey identity and sex acoustically. Our results\nwill be discussed with regard to similar data on communication\ncalls (squeaks) of tree shrews uttered during social conflicts (reanalysed [34]). Furthermore, findings on tree shrews will be compared\nto data on other mammals to explore to which extent common\nacoustic features expressing arousal level and specific caller characteristics can be found across different call types and calling contexts\nand to which degree these acoustic features may be caused by\nsimilar morphological and physiological constraints in vocal production.\n2. Methods\n2.1. Subjects\nExperimental subjects were 14 adult, captive-born tree shrews, six females\nand eight males, aged from one to six years (Table 1). Tree shrews (Tupaia belangeri) were housed in the breeding colony at the Institute of Zoology, University\nof Veterinary Medicine Hannover, Germany. All animals were used to being handled by the experimenter. They were housed solitary in wire mesh cages (size\n150 cm × 150 cm × 80 cm) from EBECO, Castrop-Rauxel, Germany. Each cage was\nequipped with at least two nest boxes, a variety of branches, and several wooden\nresting shelves. During the time of the experiments the diet consisted of Tupaia pellets (Altromin, Lage, Germany), fresh fruits and mealworms or locusts. The subjects\nwere fed once a day early in the morning and had ad libitum access to water. Animals\nwere maintained at a temperature of 25 ± 2 ◦ C, and a relative humidity of 40%. The\nlight/dark cycles were set at 14:10 with the light period beginning at 6:00 am and\nending at 8:00 pm.\n2.2. Experimental setup and data collection\nChatter calls were induced experimentally within a standardised behavioural\ncontext. We used a disturbance paradigm, in which a subject was removed from\nits home cage in its nest box and was put into an experimental cage (wire-mesh\ncage, size 50 cm × 100 cm × 75 cm from EBECO) in a sound-attenuating room. Each\nanimal was used to being handled in its nest box. We performed one experiment per\nsubject. The duration of each experiment ranged between 30 and 60 min because\nof the highly individual response of each subject to the new environment. As soon\nas the animal left its nest box and entered the experimental cage, the experiment\nstarted. The entire environment was new for each tree shrew and reliably evoked\nchatter calls. After ending of the experiment the animal was returned to its home\ncage.\nDuring an experiment, the behaviour of the tree shrews was continuously video\ntaped by a camcorder (DCR-HC 85 E, Sony, Tokyo, Japan,). The chatter calls were\nrecorded by a microphone (Sennheiser, Wedemark, Germany, K6/ME64), connected\nto a pre-amplifier (Avid Technology, Öhringen, Germany, M-Audio DMP3), and digitized with a high-speed A/D card (DAQCard-6062E, National Instruments, Austin,\nTX, USA) at a sampling frequency of 100 kHz. Recordings were made with NIDisk\n(Engineering Design, Belmont, MA, USA,) and stored as uncompressed audio files\non a laptop (Toshiba, Irvine, CA, USA, Satellite A10-s100). An audio signal (beep) at\nthe beginning of each experiment was simultaneously recorded by the camcorder\n(audio track) and by the microphone, to synchronize the behaviour with the audio\nrecordings.\n2.3. Video and sound analysis\n2.3.1. Definition of arousal state and selection of chatter calls for sound analysis\nTo examine arousal-related acoustic variation in chatter calls, we defined two\ndifferent arousal states of the animals, high vs. low. We assumed that tree shrews\nTable 1\nSubject history and medians of acoustic parameters.\nSex Age (years) Weight (gram) Intersyllable interval (ms) F0 -peak-frequency (kHz) Syllable duration (ms)\nHigh Low High Low High Low\nM 4 210 208.00 203.00 1.240 1.221 33.35 32.13\nM 4 260 210.00 195.00 1.182 1.099 52.10 45.98\nM 3 246 146.00 191.50 1.387 1.377 34.25 33.75\nM 3 248 328.50 358.00 1.421 1.528 43.00 39.83\nM 3 246 231.50 245.00 1.670 1.772 45.20 43.73\nM 3 217 217.50 273.00 1.758 1.328 43.90 29.15\nF 6 200 252.50 274.00 1.240 1.045 41.35 38.95\nF 1 177 162.00 163.00 1.440 1.172 35.83 30.70\nM 4 186 147.00 256.00 1.719 1.895 39.28 41.35\nM 1 221 173.00 227.00 1.738 1.357 46.80 42.40\nF 5 194 185.50 195.00 1.758 1.631 40.25 37.75\nF 1 181 200.00 196.50 1.689 1.689 47.88 48.70\nF 1 191 240.00 402.00 1.582 1.240 48.45 41.70\nF 1 189 189.00 124.50 1.250 1.670 43.05 37.15\nF0 = fundamental frequency.S. Schehka, E. Zimmermann / Behavioural Brain Research 203 (2009) 223–231 225\nhabituated to the new environment over time. Thus, we defined tree shrews to be in\na state of high arousal at the beginning (State A) and in a state of low arousal (State\nB) at the end of an experiment. For each subject we selected the first (State A) and\nlast (State B) chatter call of the experiment. A chatter call consisted of a sequence of\n3–50 short units, called syllables [59]. A syllable is defined as a discrete call element\nsurrounded by periods of silence [68,69]. In the chatter call, each syllable shows\na frequency-modulated contour with harmonic structure masked by noise. Calls\nuttered during jumping or running, were not selected because of possible interference due to background noise and a higher breathing rate of the subject. Moreover,\nonly calls consisting of at least three syllables were selected for further acoustical\nanalyses. If a call did not fit these criteria, the next (for State A) or previous (for State\nB) chatter call was selected for analysis.\nBecause of the highly individual responses of subjects to the new environment\nand thus the extent and duration of physiological arousal we had to determine\nif each subject did indeed show a decrease in arousal over time. Therefore, we\nlooked for tail position (upright vs. horizontally) and piloerection (ruffled vs. flat)\nof the tail hair, both well-known behavioural indicators for stress in tree shrews\n[62,65]. Using a frame-by-frame video analysis with a resolution of 25 frames/s\n(software Interact 8.0.4; Mangold, Arnstorf, Germany), we analysed tail position\n(upright/medium/horizontally) and piloerection (ruffled/medium/flat) of each subject during chattering at the beginning (State A) and at the end (State B) of an\nexperiment. We then determined an arousal-value for each chatter call and state,\nwith 1 = highest arousal (tail position upright and tail hair ruffled during 100% of\nthe duration of a call) and 0 = lowest arousal (tail position horizontally and tail hair\nflat during 100% of the duration of a call). We calculated this value using the percentage of the duration of a call multiplied by the sum of tail position (classified\nas: upright = 1/medium = 0.5/horizontally = 0) and piloerection (classified as: ruffled = 1/medium = 0.5/flat = 0) divided by two. Only the chatter calls of subjects who\nshowed a decrease in their arousal-value of at least 50% from State A to State B were\nused for further arousal-related statistical analyses (N = 9 subjects (eight males and\none female), n = 18 chatter calls).\n2.3.2. Acoustic measurement\nMultiparametric sound analyses of a total of 263 syllables of chatter calls from\n14 individuals were conducted with the software SIGNALTM (Engineering Design,\nversion 4.02.04) using a self written macro based on a 2048-point Fast Fourier\nTransformation (FFT) with a frequency resolution of 9.77 Hz (Hanning window).\nWe measured all spectral parameters with the software SIGNALTM . The temporal\nmeasurements were done manually using oscillograms produced by the software\nBatSound Pro (Pettersson Elektronik AB, Uppsala, Sweden, version 3.31). In total, 17\nacoustic parameters were measured, three in the temporal and 14 in the spectral\ndomains (Table 2).\n2.4. Statistical analyses\n2.4.1. Arousal-related variation in chatter calls\nWe first calculated the median for each acoustic parameter per subject and\narousal state. Then we compared each of these medians between low- and higharousal (State A vs. State B) by using a nonparametric test for dependent data, the\nWilcoxon Signed Rank Test [70]. Only nine of the 14 animals showed a decrease\nin their arousal-value of at least 50% from State A to State B and were thus used\nfor further arousal-related statistical analyses. In total 196 syllables (N = 9 subjects, n = 18 chatter calls) entered the statistic procedure. As we tested the same\nnull hypothesis several times, it was necessary to make a global decision on the\nnull hypothesis (the arousal state of a sender has no predictable influence on\nthe acoustic structure of the syllables of chatter calls). Therefore, we conducted\nthe Fisher’s Omnibus Test [71]. This test considered the multiple P-values of the\nseventeen Wilcoxon Signed Rank Tests to create an overall P-value. This overall\nP-value resulted in an acceptance or rejection of the null hypothesis and hence\nput aside  ̨-adjustments for each parameter. Both statistical tests were carried\nout with  ̨ set at 0.05. Fisher’s Omnibus Tests were done manually. The Wilcoxon\nSigned Ranks Tests were conducted with SPSS software (SPSS 15.0, Chicago, IL,\nUSA).\n2.4.2. Sex- and individual-specific variation in chatter calls\nFor further indexical-related statistical analyses we used all 14 animals, independently of their arousal-value. To analyse potential sex-and individual-related\nacoustic features in chatter calls, we performed permutation-based discriminant\nfunction analyses (pDFAs) as described in Mundry and Sommer [72]. In total 263\nsyllables (N = 14 subjects, n = 28 chatter calls) entered the statistic procedure. The\npDFAs were done using a script written by R. Mundry (MPI for Evolutionary Anthropology, Leipzig, Germany). This script runs in R [73] and requires the library MASS\n[74] to be loaded. For all tests, P < 0.05 was chosen as level of significance. To look for\nacoustic variation in chatter calls due to sex, we performed two pDFAs with a nested\ndesign using subject as the control factor and sex as the test factor. We considered\ntwo separate pDFAs, one for each arousal condition (high/low), to control for possible\narousal-related effects on chatter calls. To characterise individual-related acoustic\ndifferences we performed a pDFA with a crossed design using arousal condition as\nthe control factor and subject as the test factor. Had the previously performed pDFAs\nrevealed sex differences we would have had to perform a pDFA on male and female\nTable 2\nDefinition of sound parameters.\nSound parameter Definition\nNumber of syllables per call\nSyllable duration (ms) Time between onset and offset of a\nsyllable\nIntersyllable interval (ms) Time between end and onset of two\nsuccessive syllables\nPF (kHz) Maximum acoustic energy of a whole\nsyllable\nPF onset (kHz) Maximum acoustic energy at the start\n(first 5 ms) of a syllable\nPF middle (kHz) Maximum acoustic energy of the\nmiddle (5 ms) of a syllable\nPF end (kHz) Maximum acoustic energy at the end\n(last 5 ms) of a syllable\nF0 -peak-frequency (kHz) Maximum acoustic energy of the F0 of\na whole syllable\nF 0 -peak-frequency-onset (kHz) Maximum acoustic energy of the F0 in\nthe middle (5 ms) of a syllable\nF 0 -peak-frequency-middle (kHz) Maximum acoustic energy of the F0 at\nthe start (5 ms) of a syllable\nF 0 -peak-frequency-end (kHz) Maximum acoustic energy of the F0 at\nthe end (5 ms) of a syllable\nSC of a syllable Median correlation coefficient from\ncorrelations of the acoustic energy of\nsuccessive time segments (5 ms) of a\nwhole syllable\nMaximum SC of a syllable Highest correlation coefficient of\nsuccessive time segments (5 ms) of a\nwhole syllable\nMinimum SC of a syllable Lowest correlation coefficient of\nsuccessive time segments (5 ms) of a\nwhole syllable\nRange of SC of a syllable Range of the correlation coefficients of\nsuccessive time segments (5 ms) of a\nwhole syllable\nFirst FLS peak frequency (kHz) Frequency of maximum acoustic\nenergy of the first dominant frequency\nband in the middle (10 ms) of a syllable\nMaximum frequency of all FLS (kHz) Highest frequency of all dominant\nfrequency bands in the middle (10 ms)\nof a syllable\nF0 = fundamental frequency, FLS = formant-like-structure, PF = peak frequency,\nSC = spectral consistency.\ncalls separately to control for the effect of sex. For procedure details of the performed\npDFAs, see Table 3.\nSome of the requirements of a DFA must be met for the pDFA as well. A DFA reacts\nvery sensitively to missing values and thus needs a complete data set [72,75]. Accordingly, parameters with missing values must be removed from the analysis or the\nmissing values have to be replaced by group means [75]. Thus, we removed parameters with more than two missing values per individual. This was the case for the two\nFLS (formant-like-structure)-related parameters (first FLS peak frequency (kHz) and\nmaximum frequency of all FLS (kHz)). Less than two missing values per individual\nTable 3\nProcedure details and selected parameters for the three performed pDFAs.\npDFA Sex\n(high arousal)\npDFA Sex\n(low arousal)\npDFA Identity\n(both sexes)\nN levels of test factor 2 2 14\nN levels of control factor 14 14 2\nN entered parameters 5 2 7\nN syllables total 170 93 263\nN permutations 1000 1000 1000\nN random selections 100 100 100\nSyllable duration (ms) * * *\nIntersyllable interval (ms) * *\nPF onset (kHz) *\nPF middle (kHz) * *\nPF end (kHz) * *\nF0 -peak-frequency (kHz) *\nF0 -peak-frequency-onset (kHz) *\nF0 -peak-frequency-end (kHz) * *\nF0 = fundamental frequency, PF = peak frequency; * = selected parameters226 S.

Following this requirement, we reduced the number\nof parameters as a function of the smallest number of analysed syllables per subject.\nAs a first step we excluded clear arousal-related acoustic parameters from the pDFA\n(spectral consistency (SC) of a syllable, maximum SC of a syllable, minimum SC of\na syllable, and range of SC of a syllable). These parameters are traceable to disruptions in F0 control and are known to accompany changes in arousal state (e.g. [76]).\nIn the next step we excluded the parameter ‘number of syllables’, as this parameter\napplied to only one value per chatter call. Finally, we calculated Pearson’s correlation\ncoefficients and successively excluded the most highly correlated parameters until\nan appropriate number of parameters was left (Table 3). The Pearson’s correlations\nwere conducted with SPSS software (SPSS 15.0, Chicago, IL, USA).\nBecause the pDFAs found significant results, we conducted an additional independent discriminant function analysis to determine which acoustic parameters\nenabled the chatter calls to be accurately classified. To verify if the three best acoustic parameters for classifying by sex and individuality are affected by age or weight\nof the caller, we carried out Spearman correlations between body weight or age and\nthe respective highest correlated variable for the first three discriminant functions.\nWe therefore used the median value of the particular acoustic parameter per subject within a given arousal state and the caller’s respective age and weight at time of\nexperiments (Table 1). To correct the results for multiple testing we used the stepup sequential Bonferroni correction [77]. The step-up Bonferroni corrections were\ndone manually. The independent discriminant function analysis and the Spearman\ncorrelations were conducted with SPSS software (SPSS 15.0, Chicago, IL, USA).\n3. Results\n3.1. Acoustical comparison of chatter calls from two arousal states\nThe caller’s arousal state, determined by both the length of time\nthe subject was in the new environment and its tail position and\npiloerection, had a predictable influence on the acoustic structure\nof chatter calls (Fisher’s Omnibus Test: \u000236 = 88.49, P < 0.001). Six of\n15 spectral and all three temporal parameters changed significantly\nwith arousal (Figs. 1 and 2).\nChatter calls given in a state of high arousal (State A) were\ncomposed of significantly more syllables with shorter intersyllable\nintervals than in a state of low arousal (State B). Syllables given during high arousal were significantly longer and showed a significant\nupward shift in four frequency parameters (peak frequency middle, F0 -peak-middle, first FLS peak frequency, maximum frequency\nof all FLS). Also, the range of spectral consistency (SC) was signifi-\nFig. 1. Sonagram of a chatter call given in a low arousal (a) and high arousal state\n(b) of the caller.

Higher ranges of\nSC with a simultaneously lower minimum SC indicate that one or\nmore parts of the call contain stronger structural changes.\n3.2. Acoustical comparison of chatter calls from different sexes\nand individuals\nWe found no sex differences in the acoustic structure of chatter\ncalls for both performed discriminant function analysis. The first\nDFA (high arousal condition: State A) yielded an average rate of\ncorrectly classified syllables to the respective sex of 51.51% and an\naverage rate of correctly cross-validated syllables of 52.7%. The second DFA (low arousal condition: State B) showed an average rate\nof correctly classified syllables to the respective sex of 24.08% and\nan average rate of correctly cross-validated syllables of 29.67%. In\nview of the a priori probability of 50% correct classification, these\nresults indicated a relatively low assignment of chatter calls to the\nsex which produced them. The permutation-based discriminant\nfunction analysis supported the low assignment and confirmed\nthe non-significant discrimination among the syllables of chatter calls of the two sexes (State A: originally included syllables:\nP = 0.827; cross-validated syllables: P = 0.643/State B: originally\nincluded syllables: P = 0.627; cross-validated syllables: P = 0.474).\nWe thus concluded that the acoustic structure of chatter calls of\nthe two sexes did not differ significantly.\nWe then conducted one pDFA for all 14 subjects to look for individuality. The DFA showed an average rate of correctly classified\nsyllables to the respective individual of 51.59% and an average rate\nof correctly cross-validated syllables of 75.64%. In view of the a\npriori probability of about 7% correct classification, these results\nindicated a clear assignment of chatter calls to the respective individual. The pDFA supported the clear assignment of chatter calls\nto the respective subject and showed a highly significant acoustic\ndiscrimination of the 14 individuals (originally included syllables:\nP = 0.002; cross-validated syllables: P = 0.002). This result showed\nthat the measured acoustic parameters provided reliable information for identifying and discriminating the different individuals.\nThe afterwards conducted independent discriminant function analysis revealed which acoustic parameter enabled the chatter calls\nto be accurately classified. Table 4 shows the variance explained\nby each of the seven functions and the variable loadings on each\nfunction. The first three functions explained 84.6% of the variance.\nIntersyllable interval separated individuals on the first function, F0 -\npeak-frequency on the second function, and syllable duration on\nthe third function. To verify if the three acoustic parameters that\nbest classified the calls by individual identity (intersyllable interval, F0 -peak-frequency, and syllable duration) were affected by age\nor weight of the caller, we carried out Pearson correlations. The data\nused for correlations are shown in Table 5. We found no significant\ncorrelation between age or body weight of the callers and the highest correlated variable for the first three discriminant functions.\nThus, the three acoustic parameters that best classified the calls by\nindividual identity (intersyllable interval, F0 -peak-frequency, and\nsyllable duration) were not affected by age or weight of the callers\n(Table 5).\n4. Discussion\nThe acoustic structure of disturbance calls of tree shrews varied\npredictably with their arousal states, which were determined by\nboth the length of time subjects were in the new environment and\ntheir tail-positions and piloerection. This confirms our hypothesis\nthat tree shrews convey their arousal state in chatter calls. Contrary\nto our hypothesis, chatter calls of tree shrews could not be differen-S. Schehka, E.

However, the measured acoustic parameters provided\nreliable information for identifying and discriminating the different\nindividuals, whereas there was no effect of age or body weight on\nindividual-specific acoustic features.\n4.1. Acoustic features to sex and individual identity in chatter calls\nWe did not find sex-related acoustic differences in any of the\nmeasured parameters. Accordingly, despite slight body weight differences between both sexes (see Table 1 and [78]) and in contrast to\nour hypothesis, tree shrews do not convey sex by acoustic features.\nA review article about studies on primates revealed a predictable\ninfluence of sex on acoustic structure, but only when body size\nvariation between sexes is large [52]. Accordingly, the lack of sex\ndifferences in disturbance calls might be caused by a lacking conspicuous sexual dimorphism in tree shrews. Additionally, it might\nbe that other acoustic features than the measured ones convey\ninformation about the sex of the caller.\nIn contrast, the measured acoustic parameters of chatter calls\nprovided reliable information for identifying and discriminating the different individuals. This confirms our hypothesis that\nindividuality is conveyed acoustically in chatter calls.

The median difference in\nintersyllable interval length between individuals was 53 ms, in\nsyllable duration 6 ms, and in F0 -peak-frequency 281 Hz. Psychoacoustic tests to characterize temporal resolution have not yet been\ndone with tree shrews. For chinchillas and humans it was already\nshown that the minimum gap needed to detect the presence of\na short period of silence embedded in noise is about 3 ms [79].\nTherefore, the observed temporal changes in intersyllable interval\nlength between individuals may be perceivable for tree shrews.\nTests concerning the minimal noticeable differences in duration\nincrement showed a large variance in the performance across the\ndifferent species [80,81]. For humans it was shown that the minimal\nnoticeable difference in duration increment was 6.2 ms at a reference duration of 40 ms [80]. Thus, the median difference of 6 ms\nin syllable duration of chatter calls might be perceivable for the\nsubjects. Moreover, tree shrews are able to discriminate frequency\ndifferences of 42 Hz at 2 kHz and 124 Hz at 4 kHz [9]. Hence, the\nindividual differences in median F0 -peak-frequency are above the\ncorresponding frequency discrimination threshold in tree shrews\nand thus definitely perceivable for the animals.\nA reanalysis of data from a previous study on tree shrews [34]\nshowed that individuality is also conveyed acoustically in communication calls (squeaks) of females uttered during social conflicts.\nHere, about 97% of variance between the individuals was explained\nby three acoustic parameters. F0 -peak-frequency separated individuals on the first function, maximum frequency of all FLS on the\nsecond function and syllable duration on the third function (see\nsupplementary material). Again, the median individual differences\nin the frequency-related parameters (F0 -peak-frequency: 369 Hz;\nmaximum frequency of all FLS: 2104 Hz) are likely to be perceivable for the tree shrews. The median difference in syllable duration\nbetween individuals was 9.5 ms and therefore also probably perceivable for the animals.\nIn both, chatter and squeak calls of tree shrews we found no\neffect of age or body weight of the callers on the acoustic parameters\nwhich discriminated individuals best. That the individual-specific\nacoustic features were not affected by age or weight of the callers\nmight be due to too slight differences between the individuals\n(see before). All subjects were adult animals and showed a standard weight within the common range for tree shrews [78 and see\nTable 1]. However, we again cannot exclude that other individualspecific acoustic features than the measured ones provide honest\ninformation about age or body weight in communication calls of\ntree shrews.\nThe presence of individuality-related acoustic features in tree\nshrew vocalisations is not surprising because in mammals the\ndifferences in the vocal apparatus between individuals may\ndirectly influence the spectral–temporal structure of vocalisations\n[9,10,13,18]. Temporal parameters, such as the duration of syllables or intersyllabel interval length are influenced by the individual\nlung capacity and the control of the emptying speed of the air flow.\nThus, similar physiological constraints may be responsible for the\ntemporal differences in chatter and squeak calls between the individuals. According to the source-filter theory of speech production\n[56], the size of the vocal folds determines the characteristics of the\nF0 and thus causes acoustic variation related to F0 parameters. This\nmorphological constraint may explain the F0 -related differences,\nwhich contributed to distinguishing individuals in both call types.\nFinally, the size of the vocal tract and its deformation during vocal\nproduction affect parameters related to the filter characteristics of\nthe sound, which describe the distribution of energy among the\nspectrum. Following Rendall et al. [83], acoustic individuality is predominantly caused by differences in the filter function of the vocal\ntract. In this study we measured two parameters related to the filter\ncharacteristics of the sound (first FLS peak frequency and maximum\nfrequency of all FLS). But because of missing values these parameters had to be removed from the sex- and individuality-related\nstatistical analyses. However, for squeak calls of female tree shrews\nwe found that the maximum frequency of all FLS provided information for identifying and discriminating the different individuals.\nOur results are consistent with studies on other mammalian species\nin which parameters related to the F0 , the distribution of energy\namong the spectrum, and temporal properties are found to be\nhighly individually specific [27,36,55,84–86]. Most likely, inherent\nmorphological and physiological constraints may be responsible for\ncomparable acoustic features in the vocal conveyance of individuality.\nThe ability for vocal recognition of individuals may be important for individuals with repeated interactions [87–89]. In tree\nshrews, mates have overlapping territories, but often forage solitarily [60,63]. Thus, it may be important for them to vocally recognise\neach other over distances. Ongoing playback experiments will\nexplore the ability for acoustic recognition of individuals.\n4.2. Acoustic features to arousal in chatter calls\nChatter calls given in a state of high arousal were characterized\nby a higher number of syllables per call, longer syllable durations,\nshorter intersyllable intervals, and an increase in PF middle, first\nFLS peak frequency and maximum frequency of all FLS. Moreover,\nhigh arousal was communicated by a higher range of SC of a syllable\nand a lower minimum SC.\nThe median difference between the two arousal conditions in\nintersyllable interval length and syllable duration was 29.5 and\n2.5 ms, respectively. Median frequency shifts ranged from 122 Hz\n(for F0 -peak-frequency-end) to 840 Hz (for PF middle). The arousalrelated frequency changes in chatter calls are perceivable for\nthe animals [82]. The temporal changes, especially the observed\ndifferences in intersyllable interval length, are also probably perceivable for the animals [80,81]. As postulated by Ehret [90] and\nadditionally already shown in playback studies (e.g. [22,91]), the\nchanges in repetition rate of syllables in calls may be of potential behavioural relevance for the perception of the urgency of\na response. Ongoing playback experiments will explore to which\nextent the observed differences in the acoustic features are perceivable and of behavioural relevance for tree shrews.\nIn order to compare our findings on chatter and squeak calls,\nwe reanalysed acoustic data of a previous study on squeak calls\n[34], using the identical set of measured acoustic parameters for\nboth call types (Table 6 and supplementary material). Our results\nshowed that two temporal acoustic features, syllable duration and\nnumber of syllables, varied only in the chatter, but not in the squeak\ncalls of tree shrews. In the chatter calls, both parameters showed\nan increase with increasing arousal. Tree shrews usually utter chatter calls during disturbance or when they are confronted with new\nenvironmental stimuli [60]. Thus, the proximate function may be toS. Schehka, E. Zimmermann / Behavioural Brain Research 203 (2009) 223–231 229\nTable 6\nComparison of acoustic variation associated with an increasing arousal in chatter and squeak calls.\nSound parameter Chatter calls Squeak calls\nTemporal-related acoustic features Number of syllables per call *↑ –\nSyllable duration (ms) *↑ –\nIntersyllable interval (ms) *↓ *↓\nFrequency-related acoustic features PF (kHz) – –\nPF onset (kHz) – –\nPF middle (kHz) *↑ –\nPF end (kHz) – –\nF0 -peak-frequency (kHz) – *↑\nF0 -peak-frequency-onset (kHz) – *↑\nF0 -peak-frequency-middle (kHz) – –\nF0 -peak-frequency-end (kHz) *↑ –\nFirst FLS peak frequency (kHz) *↑ –\nMaximum frequency of all FLS (kHz) *↑ –\nSpectral-consistency-related acoustic features SC of a syllable – –\nMaximum SC of a syllable – –\nMinimum SC of a syllable *↓ –\nRange of SC of a syllable *↑ –\nF0 = fundamental frequency, FLS = formant-like-structure, PF = peak frequency, SC = spectral consistency; * = significant differences, ↑ = increasing value, ↓ = decreasing value.\nattract attention from other individuals and thus reflect attempts\nto signal more emphatically. This function is likely to be enhanced\nby a higher number of syllables or longer syllable durations. In contrast, the typical proximate function of squeaking is probably not\nto attract the attention from other individuals, but rather to signal\nthe perceived degree of social threat [34]. Hence, the different use of\nthese arousal-related acoustic features may be due to the dissimilar\nproximate functions of the calls. Irrespective of the proximate function of calling, the variable pattern relating both parameters syllable\nduration and number of syllables, is consistent with previous work\non arousal-related acoustic features. In alarm calls of suricates an\nincrease in urgency was associated with a significant decrease of\nsyllable duration [25]. Juvenile hyenas varied their long-distance\nvocalisations with changing arousal, but no effect was found on\nthe number or duration of syllables [91]. Blumstein and Armitage\n[22] showed that yellow-bellied marmots emit more alarm calls\nwhen risk increases. Two studies on non-human primates, one\non disturbance calls [26] and one on social calls (grunts) [17]\nreported that increasing arousal was associated with longer syllable\ndurations.\nAcoustic features related to the SC (spectral consistency) of syllables varied again only in the chatter and not in the squeak calls\n(Table 6). The variable pattern of this acoustic feature is consistent\nwith work on voice quality in humans. Here, comparable measures\nof vocal perturbation (e.g. jitter) may vary with changes in arousal,\nbut does not always do so [76].\nA general explanation for the differences between the call types\nin conveying arousal might be that some acoustic variables reflect\nnot only changes in arousal, but are also linked to specific affective\nstates of the caller [40]. In tree shrews, chatter and squeak calls are\nusually uttered in obviously different behavioural contexts. Accordingly, the underlying affective state of the caller may be different\nduring each. Hence, acoustic features as syllable duration, number\nof syllables and structural variation might not be associated with\narousal-related variations accompanying squeaking in tree shrews.\nThe comparison between chatter and squeak calls illustrated\nthat with increasing arousal both call types were characterized\nby shorter intersyllable intervals and an upward shift in several\nfrequency-related acoustic features (Table 6).\nThese comparable patterns in arousal-related acoustic features\nacross different call types and calling contexts within one species\nmay be caused by common physiological constraints in the process of sound production. The increased amount and rate of calling\ncan be explained by a faster breathing rate, which is an effect of\nthe level of sympathetic activity [14,40]. According to the sourcefilter theory [56], increasing frequencies can be explained by an\nincrease in subglottal air pressure and an increase in general muscle\ntone of the vocal folds, both again effects of the level of sympathetic activity [14,40]. Thus, higher arousal states in mammals\nmay be effects of sympathetic arousal, influencing vocal production by changes in respiration, phonation, and articulation in such\na way as to produce arousal-specific patterns of acoustic features [14,40,92]. The results on tree shrews are mostly consistent\nwith previous work on arousal-related acoustic features. Changes\nin repetition rates and frequency shifts are the most commonly\ncited acoustic features associated with changes in arousal across\ndifferent mammalian lineages (Carnivora, Artiodactyla, Rodentia,\nScandentia, Chiroptera, and Primates) and calling contexts (predation, aggression, disturbance, group movements, mother–infant\ninteractions, dominant–subdominant encounters, and foraging)\n[17,22–28,32]. An increase in arousal is generally associated with\nan increase in overall articulation rate in humans (e.g. [19,41,93])\nand, in non-human animals, with the amount and rate of calling\n(e.g. [17,22,27,94]). Moreover, an increase in various frequencyrelated parameters is a commonly cited acoustic feature associated\nwith high arousal in humans (e.g. [19,41,93]) as well as non-human\nmammals (e.g. [17,24,36,37]). The similar findings across mammalian lineages provide evidence that comparable physiological\nconstraints in the production of airborne vocalisations lead to\nacoustic commonalities in the vocal expression of arousal.\nAcknowledgements\nThis work was supported by the DFG Research Group 499.

Partee, University of Massachusetts, Amherst, MA, and approved October 8, 2009 (received for review July 22, 2009)\nAccording to a controversial hypothesis, a characteristic unique to\nhuman language is recursion. Contradicting this hypothesis, it has\nbeen claimed that the starling, one of the two animal species tested\nfor this ability to date, is able to distinguish acoustic stimuli based\non the presence or absence of a center-embedded recursive structure. In our experiment we show that another songbird species, the\nzebra finch, can also discriminate between artificial song stimuli\nwith these structures. Zebra finches are able to generalize this\ndiscrimination to new songs constructed using novel elements\nbelonging to the same categories, similar to starlings. However, to\ndemonstrate that this is based on the ability to detect the putative\nrecursive structure, it is critical to test whether the birds can also\ndistinguish songs with the same structure consisting of elements\nbelonging to unfamiliar categories. We performed this test and\nshow that seven out of eight zebra finches failed it. This suggests\nthat the acquired discrimination was based on phonetic rather than\nsyntactic generalization. The eighth bird, however, must have used\nmore abstract, structural cues. Nevertheless, further probe testing\nshowed that the results of this bird, as well as those of others,\ncould be explained by simpler rules than recursive ones. Although\nour study casts doubts on whether the rules used by starlings and\nzebra finches really provide evidence for the ability to detect\nrecursion as present in ‘‘context-free’’ syntax, it also provides\nevidence for abstract learning of vocal structure in a songbird.\nbiolinguistics \u0001 discrimination learning \u0001 rule learning \u0001 syntax\nStudying how different features of human language relate to\nvocal and cognitive abilities in other animals can provide\ninsights into the evolution of the language faculty. A key feature\nof language is its syntax: the system of rules that govern the\nconstruction of sentences by combining smaller elements such as\nwords. It is broadly accepted that the rules that structure animal\nvocalizations are much simpler than those that structure human\nlanguage, but it is hard to pinpoint the critical difference. In an\ninfluential but controversial paper, Hauser, Chomsky, and Fitch\n(1) formulated various possible hypotheses, one of them stating\nthat ‘‘recursion is the only uniquely human component of the\nfaculty of language’’ (see also below).\nRecursion is typically defined as the embedding of a unit of a\nparticular category inside a larger unit of the same category. In\nthe context of language this enables so called ‘‘discrete infinity,’’\nwhereby an unbounded number of different sentences can be\nconstructed from a limited number of different words. For\ninstance, the sentence ‘‘the woman saw,’’ can be embedded in\n‘‘the man left,’’ which results in: ‘‘the man the woman saw left.’’\nWhen we represent the noun phrases with As and the verbs with\nBs, this sentence follows an AABB structure, with an AB\n‘‘recursively’’ embedded inside another AB. (But see below; the\nDiscussion and ref. 2 for the concerns about the actual definition\nof linguistic recursion; its relation with mathematical recursion\nand its usage by humans.)\nA formalism often used to describe such center-embedded\nrecursion is that of context-free grammars, which form a distinct\nlevel in a popular complexity metric known as the Chomsky\nHierarchy; the AnBnstructure (requiring an arbitrary but equal\nnumber of As and Bs) is an example of a structure that cannot\nbe generated by grammars on lower levels on the Chomsky\nHierarchy. This is because it requires an unbounded memory to\nmake sure as many Bs are produced as there were As in a string.\nNo such memory is required to produce sentences that follow the\n(AB)n structure (such as ABAB or ABABABAB) in which the\nnext AB is concatenated to the previous AB; This is an example\nof a structure that can be generated by a Finite State Grammar.\nIt is widely accepted that finite-state grammars are insufficient\nfor describing the syntax of human language (3). In contrast, there\nis no evidence to date showing that animal vocalizations are also\nbeyond the power of finite-state grammars. However, there is a\ndebate about whether animals have the cognitive ability to detect\nmore complex syntactic rules in artificially constructed stimuli.\nUntil now, two studies have addressed this issue in other species,\none on non-human primates and one on a songbird species.\nFitch and Hauser (4) trained and tested humans and cotton-top\ntamarins (Saguinus oedipus) in a familiarization/discrimination paradigm for the ability to distinguish between the above mentioned\ntypes of structures. The auditory stimuli consisted of (human)\nconsonant-vowel (CV) syllables spoken by males and females\norganized in AnBn or (AB)n structures (with n \u0001 2 or n \u0001 3). While\nhumans were sensitive to a change in structure in either direction,\nthe tamarins did not seem to notice a transition from the AnBn to\nthe (AB)n structure. Fitch and Hauser (4) interpreted this as\nevidence that tamarins are unable to learn context-free languages\nand are limited to the less complex, non-hierarchical finite-state\nlanguages such as the ABAB structure.\nThe experiments gave rise to a lively debate, ranging from\nquestions such as whether the stimuli really represented a\nsuitable test of the ability to detect recursive structures, to\nwhether animals as well as humans can ‘‘solve’’ the task by using\nless complex, non-recursive strategies (2, 5–12).\nFrom a methodological perspective, one concern about the study\nis that non-conspecific, human speech stimuli were used to test the\ntamarins, while this species (like most primate species) also has a\nlimited vocal repertoire and lacks the ability for vocal learning. The\nfailure of the tamarins might thus be explained by more basic\nfeatures of their perceptual and learning abilities rather than the\nability to represent and process syntactic structure. A stronger test\nfor the human uniqueness of syntax comes from comparative\nstudies with animals, such as songbirds, showing vocal learning and\ncomplex vocalizations, in particular from studies where the stimuli\nconsist of units present in their natural vocalizations.

The\ngrammar stimuli were constructed from two of these natural phrase\ntypes: ‘‘rattles’’ and ‘‘warbles.’’\nGentner et al. (13) trained starlings in a go/no-go experiment,\na different paradigm than the habituation/dishabituation experiment that was used to test discriminatory abilities in tamarins.\nIn this go/no-go experiment, the bird has to respond to one type\nof stimuli, but withhold responses to the other. Contrary to the\ntamarin experiment by Hauser and Fitch (4) in which recognizing each grammar was tested separately by presenting violations\n(the other grammar) in a habituation/dishabituation experiment,\nin this go/no-go experiment, the discrimination between the two\ngrammars was tested directly. The authors reported that starlings, unlike the cotton-top tamarins, were able to “accurately\nrecognize (...) a recursive, self-embedding, context-free grammar,” “classify new patterns defined by the grammar and reliably\nexclude agrammatical patterns.” This claim entails that the\ncapacity to detect recursion in auditory sequences would not be\nuniquely human. In support of the claim, the study included a\nrange of controls for alternative (simpler, but still abstract) rules\nthat the birds could have used to distinguish the two stimuli sets.\nLike the tamarin experiment, the starling experiment by\nGentner et al. (13) received a (similar) variety of comments that\nwere brought up before in response to HCF (1) and Fitch and\nHauser (4). These mainly concerned the actual recursiveness of\nthe test stimuli and the way they were presented; the level of\nabstract rule learning that the starlings showed; the relatively\nhigh number of trials the starlings needed to learn the task and\nthe correctness of the implications the authors mention for the\nunique characteristics in human language (2, 9–12, 15, 16).\nBut while the discussion on the experiment in terms of whether\nit is an appropriate test of the presence of recursion lingers on,\na more basic question about what the starlings have actually\nlearned has received little attention (but see refs. 2 and 16): did\nthey learn an abstract rule allowing them to generalize from\nfamiliar to novel stimuli? Gentner et al. (13) showed that\nstarlings generalized from familiar rattle and warble structures\nto unfamiliar ones, but not that they generalized to other phrase\ntypes as well. Therefore, the birds could also have based their\ndiscrimination on a phonetic categorization, restricted to rattle\nand warble phrase types. That is, they might classify all ‘‘rattlewarble-rattle-warble’’ sequences as one type, different from\n‘‘rattle-rattle-warble-warble’’ sequences, based on the overall\nacoustic similarity alone [and with the appropriate similarity\nmetric, this would generalize to larger n without a need for a\nsyntactic analysis (17)]. So the question whether the birds have\nthe abstract computational abilities that enable them to discriminate between the two stimuli sets strictly based on order\ninformation is still open.\nTo test this, the birds should be presented with a new set of\nsong stimuli, consisting of new phrase types (for instance structures constructed of Cs and Ds). In this case, the birds cannot use\nphonetic generalization, but have to attend to the sequence of\nphrase types, requiring some level of abstract computational\nskill. In the current paper, we present such an experiment with\nanother songbird species, the zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata).\nUsing a similar setup as the Gentner et al. study (13)—including,\nimportantly, the use of a probe methodology to test for a range\nof alternative hypotheses—we extend their results by explicitly\ntesting for generalization and by a more in-depth statistical\nanalysis of the probes.\nThe zebra finch is widely used as a model species in neuro- and\nbehavioral sciences and knowledge about the perceptual abilities\nof this species would be greatly beneficial to these research areas.\nAn additional reason for choosing the zebra finch is the suggestion that the complex perceptual ability in starlings could be\nrelated to the relatively complex structure of their natural songs\n(18). The song of the zebra finch is relatively simple, consisting\nof a limited number of elements and a relatively stereotyped\nsequence (e.g., refs. 19–23). Nevertheless, zebra finches are able\nto discriminate between songs with subtle differences such as the\nnumber of repeated elements and the relative position of a\ncertain element in a song (24). So our experiment also tests\nwhether birds with much simpler songs are able to detect more\nabstract patterns in vocal structures.\nThe results from this experiment show that zebra finches, like\nstarlings, can discriminate between sets of two syntactically\ndifferent song stimuli and can generalize this discrimination to\nunfamiliar exemplars of the same stimulus types.\nIn addition, when confronted with novel stimulus types arranged identically to the earlier ones, one out of eight birds was\nable to correctly classify the stimuli, an ability that so far has not\nbeen shown in any other songbird. However, additional ‘‘probe\ntests’’ to examine the rules that the birds used to discriminate\nbetween syntactically different sets, suggest that all birds used\nsimpler rules to discriminate between the sets with and without\n‘‘recursion.’’\nResults\nTransfer from One Song to Five Songs of Each Structure. During the\ntraining phase, the birds learned to discriminate between a single\nABAB and one AABB stimulus (see Fig. 1 A and B. See SI Text\nfor two example song stimuli used in this experiment). As the two\nstructures consisted of identical elements, the only way to\ndiscriminate between the two is by learning about the order of\nthe individual elements within the structures, an ability demonstrated in zebra finches before (24).\nThe simplest mechanism to do this would be to learn the sound\ncharacteristics of each structure; that is, by rote memorization.\nWe tested this by presenting additional stimuli (2  4) of the\nsame structures but constructed of different element exemplars.\nIf the birds based their discrimination on the individual sound\ncharacteristics of the two stimuli, they would perceive this as a\nnew task and show a considerable drop in DR after transfer to\n0.50 and a d\u0004 of around zero, meaning no discrimination (see\nrefs. 13 and 25 for method of calculating the d\u0004 and its confidence\ninterval). Alternatively, if the birds learned a more general rule\neither related to the sequential structure of the sounds, or their\nphonetic structure, they should be able to generalize to the\nFig. 1.

Fig. 2B shows the average discrimination ratios per 100\ntrials before and after transfer to 5 ABABs and 5 AABBs.\nDirectly after transfer, there is an initial drop of the DR to 0.56,\nwhich is slightly higher than random performance, but the birds\nlearned to discriminate faster than during the previous task. This\ncan be concluded from the d’ measures: for the first two 100-trial\nblocks, six out of eight birds discriminated significantly between\nthe two sets, and seven out of eight were able to do so during\nblocks 3–5 after transfer (see Table 1). Hence, we can conclude\nthat most birds were able to generalize to the additional stimuli.\nTransfer from Five Songs of Each Stimulus Type to Five Novel Songs\nof Each Type. With additional training, all birds reached criterion\nperformance. However, the question remains whether the birds\nlearned an abstract computational rule to discriminate between\nthese ABAB songs and AABB songs or whether there is a\nlower-level explanation (i.e., learning the 10 songs by rote\nmemorization or by phonetic generalization).\nTo test whether the zebra finches are able to generalize\nindependent of the characteristics of the individual elements in\nthe stimuli, a different set of stimuli of the same element\ncategories was introduced. From stimuli constructed of a1–5 and\nb1–5, each bird was transferred abruptly to stimuli constructed\nfrom a6–10 and b6–10 when it reached criterion performance. See\nFig. 2C for average discrimination ratios per 100 trials before and\nafter transfer to 2  5 novel songs of each structure. After\ntransfer, the average DR remained \u00050.50. The slight drop\nindicates that the birds do notice a difference between the first\nand second sets, but they treated the novel stimuli similar to the\nprevious ones. Seven out of eight birds generalized to the new\nstimuli within the first two blocks and all birds did so within\nblocks 3–5 (see Table 1). This outcome suggests that they used\na general rule instead of rote memorization of all individual\nsongs to base discrimination on.\nIt is here that the question arises what exactly the birds use to\ngeneralize: an abstract rule (as suggested by Gentner et al., ref.\n13), or a lower-level process, such as phonetic generalization.\nThe use of an abstract computational rule would predict a\ntransfer of the discrimination to songs of any element type, as\nlong as they occur in a same order. The question thus is whether\nthe birds can generalize independent of element type.\nTransfer from Five Songs of Each Stimulus Type to Five Songs with\nNew Element Types (As and Bs to Cs and Ds). To test whether the\nzebra finches are able to generalize to new songs independent of\nelement type, each bird was transferred abruptly to Cs and Ds;\nthat is, other types of elements instead of As and Bs, when it\nreached criterion performance (see Fig. 1C). The average DRs\nbefore and after transfer are shown in Fig. 2D. The average DR\nafter transfer stayed just \u00050.50, but all d\u0006s for the initial two\nblocks after transfer were not significant. For blocks 3–5 however, three of the eight birds showed significant discrimination\n(see Table 1). However, two of these three birds dropped to\nchance performance again (DR of 0.50) shortly after this\ninterval. But the third bird, m574, remained on a high discrimination level (see Fig. 3). Only after training did the seven other\nbirds learn to discriminate between the new stimuli sets, indicating that they perceived this as a new task.\nSo we conclude that seven out of eight birds were unable to\ngeneralize the discrimination of the stimuli to novel ones using\nstructure cues only. However, there was one zebra finch that\nshowed a clearly different response pattern and was likely to be\nable to generalize independent of element types and therefore\nused a more abstract general rule.\nTesting for the Use of Other, Simpler Rules to Discriminate Between\nABABs and AABBs. One bird (m574) showed that he was capable\nof generalizing across element types and so apparently used a\nmore abstract rule for distinguishing between the stimuli sets\nthan the other birds. However, the rule it used might not have\nbeen ‘‘recursive,’’ but could have been a more simple, lower-level\nstrategy. For instance, ABAB and AABB differ in their first two\nelements and therefore can be discriminated based on this\ndifference instead of all four elements (‘‘primacy rule’’). Similarly, discrimination might be based on the last two elements only\n(‘‘recency rule’’).\nFig. 2.

(13). In this testing phase, four\nbirds were exposed to probe songs. Probe songs were not\nreinforced to avoid additional learning and presented in only\n20% of all stimulus presentations to prevent extinction of the\npecking behavior. The other 80% of stimulus presentations were\nthe reinforced stimulus songs to which the birds were exposed\nduring the previous phase (Table 2 provides individual responses\nto these probes; see Fig. 1D, an example.)\nTo test whether the birds showed a differential response to the\nprobes, we tested for each bird individually whether the responses to the probes differed, which it did (binomial test in R,\ny\tprobetype, family \u0001 quasibinomial). All deletion P values for\nprobe type were significant (largest P value was \n0.05), indicating that all four birds did not respond in a random manner to\nthe probe songs.\nHowever, the pattern of responses to probes did not fit either\nof the grammars used to define the training stimuli. Like\nGentner et al. (13), we considered the alternative hypotheses\nthat for distinguishing the training stimuli the birds used a\nstrategy based only on the first transition in each sequence (AA\nvs. AB, ‘‘primacy’’), the last transition (BB vs. AB, ‘‘recency’’) or\nany transition (the presence vs. absence of AA, BB or BA,\n‘‘bigram’’). Gentner et al. (13) try to exclude these alternative\nstrategies by showing that the birds are significantly better at\ndistinguishing between the two sets of training stimuli than\nbetween a contrasting pair of probe stimuli. That is, the d\u0004\nbetween ABAB and AABB is significantly larger than between\nBAAB and ABBA, which Gentner et al. (13) take as excluding\nthe bigram hypotheses.\nHowever, given that the d\u0004 is significantly smaller for all pairs\nof probe stimuli, including the ‘‘context-free’’ probes AAABBB\nand AAAABBBB, that is not the relevant test. We performed\na maximum likelihood analysis instead, evaluating for every\nindividual bird which of the considered alternative hypotheses\nbest explains the observed data. From such an analysis (as shown\nin Table 2) we deduced that m574, the bird that was able to\ngeneralize to new element types, did so without using the\ncontext-free strategy. If he had acquired this strategy, he should\nnot respond to the following probes, AAAB, AAAA, BBBB,\nBAAB and ABBA. The results show that he did in fact respond\nto for instance, BBBB. His pattern of response best fits a\nBB-recency strategy (responding selectively to sequences ending\nin BB). Two other birds most likely used ‘‘bigram AA’’ to\ndistinguish between the sets; one bird used ‘‘primacy AA.’’\nDiscussion\nThis paper addressed the question whether songbirds are able to\ndiscriminate between vocal structures with and without a ‘‘center-embedded recursive’’ structure. The results of our experiment show that all zebra finches learned to discriminate between\ntwo stimulus sets that solely differed in the order of the elements.\nThis shows that a songbird species lacking complex and variable\nsongs can be highly sensitive to song structure, corroborating\nresults in a different context by Verzijden et al. (24).\nWe show that zebra finches are able to generalize from\ntraining exemplars to new song stimuli consisting of new elements of the same element types. A number of birds showed a\nslightly delayed generalization response after certain transfers to\nnew stimuli. The magnitude of their discrimination (described by\nthe DR and d\u0004) was reduced directly after transfer (blocks 1 and\n2), which would not be expected for generalization. However,\ntheir recovery during blocks 3–5 was faster than would be\nexpected if they had perceived this as a new task (i.e., compared\nto for instance, the response behavior after transfer to the first\nABAB and AABB).\nUntil this stage, the experiment ran parallel to Gentner et al.\n(13). However, our main objective was to test whether songbirds\nare able to generalize independently of phonetic characteristics\nof the element types that are used in the stimulus songs. The\nresults of our additional transfer stage showed that only one bird\nwas able to discriminate the stimuli independent of element type.\nThis zebra finch was therefore able to use more abstract skills\nthan the others. However, additional testing showed that, just as\nother zebra finches, this bird did not use a “recursive” strategy,\nbut, a simpler strategy (although still abstracting over phonetic\ndetail). From an efficiency point of view, this makes sense as it\nwould be inefficient to use relatively complex rules, when simpler\nrules suffice. We conclude that the current experimental paradigm, although yielding interesting results, has not answered the\nquestions whether zebra finches have the ability to detect\nrecursion.\nHowever, this conclusion also applies to previous studies on\nthis issue. For the starling experiment of Gentner et al. (13) for\ninstance, it is still not clear whether the data allow the rejection\nof the primacy rule, for two reasons.\nFirst, the mean d\u0004 between AAAA and ABBA was significantly lower than between AABB and ABAB, but it was still\nsignificantly \u00050 (0.99 \u0007 0.40 SEM). Consequently, it cannot be\nruled out that the starlings (at least partly) used a primacy rule\ninstead of a ‘‘recursion’’ rule.\nSecond, our zebra finches used different individual strategies\n(see Table 2) to discriminate between the stimulus songs.\nGentner et al. (13) reported the mean d\u0004 \u0007 SEM instead of the\nindividual d\u0006s. Therefore, if starlings also show individually\ndifferent strategies, every other comparison than between\nAABB and ABAB is likely to produce a less clear result, as all\nother comparisons are a mixture of one or more birds that did\nor did not use the tested strategy. This would mean that contrary\nto the authors’ conclusions, the evidence whether starlings are\nable to detect recursion is inconclusive.\nInterestingly, the same uncertainty remains about human\nabilities in artificial language learning tasks. The findings in (4)\nlacked the appropriate controls, but later replications claim that\nthe AABB/ABAB task, which Fitch and Hauser (4) designed to\nobtain evidence for recursion, can be solved by humans using a\nsimpler strategy instead (5, 9) or by a conscious counting strategy\nthat seems unrelated to language (11). At present, there is thus\nno convincing demonstration of the use of recursive rules in\nartificial language learning in any species. It remains a challenge\nto design experiments on artificial rule learning and its underlying mechanisms that unambiguously exclude simpler explanaTable 2.

Combined\nwith the fact that it is far from clear that recursion actually is the\nonly unique aspect of human language (see refs. 27 and 28), or\neven a particularly relevant feature (29), it might be time to\nswitch the attention to the pattern recognition abilities of zebra\nfinches and other species, which are remarkable in their own\nright, quite independently from the question of the origin of\nrecursion in human language. With this study, we have uncovered some details of those abilities in zebra finches, extended the\nexperimental paradigm to address such questions and hopefully\ncontributed to putting the claim for or against the human\nuniqueness of recursion in the right perspective.\nMaterials and Methods\nSubjects and Housing. Eight zebra finches from our breeding colony (six males\nand two females; age range: 137–363 days at the start of the experiment) were\nindividually trained and tested in this experiment. They had no previous\nexperience with similar experiments.\nBefore the experiment, the birds were housed in the breeding colony in\nsame sex groups of two to six individuals and on a 13.5 L:10.5 D schedule at\n20 –22 °C. Drinking water, cuttlebone and a commercial tropical seed mixture\nenriched with minerals was available ad libitum. Twice a week, the birds\nreceived some egg food and seedlings from the seed mixture.\nApparatus. During the experiment, subjects were individually housed in an\noperant conditioning chamber [70 (l)  30 (d)  45 (h) cm], constructed of wire\nmesh front and side walls, and a ply wood back wall. The cage was placed in\na sound-attenuated chamber. Water and cuttlebone were available ad libitum. A fluorescent tube (Lumilux De Luxe Daylight, Osram) was placed on top\nof the cage, with the same light/dark schedule as the breeding colony (except\nduring punishment reinforcement, see go/no-go procedure). The back wall\ncontained two red pecking sensors with red LED lights and a food hatch.\nStimuli were played through a speaker (Vifa MG10SD09 – 08) located 1 m\nabove the operant conditioning chamber and calibrated to a (peak) output of\napproximately 70 dB (SPL meter, RION NL 15, RION) at the food hatch. The\nfluorescent tube, the two sensors, the food hatch, and speaker were connected to a custom-made operant conditioning chamber controller that also\nregistered the sensor pecks. To monitor their condition, the birds were\nweighed before and after the experiment and their food intake was measured\ndaily. The study was conducted according to Association for the Study of\nAnimal Behavior guidelines on animal experimentation as well as to the Dutch\nlaw on animal experimentation. The Leiden Committee for animal experimentation (DEC) approved the experiment under number 06150.\nSong Stimuli Construction. We constructed stimulus songs, each containing\nfour units, as in the earlier studies (4, 13). In our case, these units were elements\nobtained from natural zebra finch song from our zebra finch song database\n(consisting of undirected song, for recording specifications see ref. 23).\nFour element types occurring in natural zebra finch song (‘‘flats,’’ ‘‘slides,’’\n‘‘highs,’’ and ‘‘trills’’ (see Fig. 1) were selected that were easily distinguishable\nby visual inspection. The first three have previously been recognized as\nelement types by several authors (e.g., 19 –22). The fourth, the trill, characterized by rapid and repeated frequency modulation and, is less well known\nbut occurs in songs from our laboratory (23) and has been previously described\nas a ‘‘click’’ (30) and as a ‘‘buzz’’ (31).\nAn element library of 40 (10  4) elements was constructed by selecting\nelements from songs in our zebra finch song lab database. All elements (as\nwell as the shaping stimuli) were ramped (3 ms) and rms (0.1) equalized in\nPRAAT (version 4.5.08, www.praat.org).\nSubsequently, 40 stimulus songs were constructed, each consisting of four\ndifferent elements, with 40 ms as an inter-element pause. Each four-element\nsong consisted of two element types, As and Bs, and were ordered in either the\nABAB structure or the AABB structure. In a later phase we used elements of\nanother type (Cs and Ds). Songs always consisted of non-identical elements\nwithin element types. So a1b1a2b2 was a member of the ABAB type set and\na1a2b1b2 for its equivalent in the AABB type set. For more information on\nprobe stimuli construction, see SI Text.\nTo pretrain the birds for the experiment, two other stimuli were constructed which were similarly ramped and equalized as the elements from the\nelement database: a natural zebra finch song motif, 0.58 s in duration,\nrandomly chosen from our zebra finch song database and a 2-kHz tone of\nidentical duration as the S\u000b, also constructed in PRAAT.\nTo control for order effects, the element types of the stimuli songs that the\nexperiment was started with (As and Bs) was counterbalanced between birds.\nSo the other half of the birds started with Cs and Ds and were in this phase\ntransferred to As and Bs.\nGo/No-Go Procedure. The birds were trained in a go/no-go procedure with a\nfood reward to test their ability to discriminate between stimuli of the ABAB\nand AABB structures.\nA peck on the left sensor, when its LED was on, initiated a playback of a\npositive ‘‘go’’ stimulus song (S\u000b, the natural zebra finch song motif). After this\nsong was finished, the LED in the right sensor was switched on and pecking on\nit opened the food hatch for 10 s (positive reinforcement). When the bird\npecked at the right sensor within 6-s response interval for at least 75%, the\nnegative ‘‘no-go’’ stimulus (S\b, the tone), was introduced in 60% of the cases\nthe bird pecked the left sensor. Subsequently, the bird had to learn not to peck\nat the right sensor after hearing an S\b stimulus, or the lights would go out for\n15 s (negative reinforcement).\nAfter the bird reached criterion performance (\u000575% response after S\u000b and\n\n25% response after S\b for at least two full consecutive days) and a phase\nwhere the ratio of S\u000b/S\b was set to 50/50 (in random order), the training with\nthe two stimuli sets began. The type of stimulus, either ABAB or AABB, was\nmapped on the S\u000b and S\b, and was counterbalanced between birds. Half of the\nbirds received the ABAB songs as the S\u000b stimuli and the AABB songs as the S\b\nstimuli.\nStatistics. Discrimination by each zebra finch was visualized by plotting the DR\n(discrimination ratio, calculated as the percentage response to S\u000b divided by\nthe sum of the percentage response to S\u000b and the percentage response to S\b),\nbut was measured with d’ (both per 100 trials), which is independent of\nresponse bias (25). A Confidence Interval for d’ with a lower bound \u00050 was\nconsidered as significant discrimination between two stimuli sets. Two intervals after transfer to a new set of stimuli were tested: the first two blocks and\nblocks 3–5. See refs. 13 and 25 for method of calculating the d\u0004 and its\nconfidence interval. Some birds showed a continued response bias during one\nor more phases. If this occurred in combination with a very low S\b, and hence\na high DR we decided to transfer the particular bird to the next phase when\ntheir DR was \u00050.75 for at least two full consecutive days (alternative learning\ncriterion).\nFor the statistics on the data from the probe testing, see SI Text.\nTraining Phase: Transfer from Song and Tone to One ABAB and One AABB Song.\nAfter the pretraining with a song and a tone and the birds reached criterion\nperformance, the stimuli were abruptly changed (transferred) to one exemplar of ABAB and one of AABB. Just before transfer, the birds (n \u0001 8) had an\naverage d\u0004 of 3.49 \u0007 0.26 (SEM) and a range for the lower bound of the 95%\nconfidence interval (CI range) of 1.95–3.45 calculated for the last two blocks\nof 100 trials each.\nIt can be seen in the graph (Fig. 2A, DR 0.50) and from the d’ value and\nits CI range in Table 1 (d\u0004 0.04 \u0007 0.09, lower bounds of the individual CIs\nbetween \b0.54 and \b0.21) that this is indeed the case for the first two blocks\nof 100 trials after transfer (d\u0004is near zero, which means no discrimination). The\nbirds seem to start from scratch again, that is, there was no obvious transfer\nof the go/no-go paradigm to novel stimuli, as indicated by the finding that\nnone of the birds was significantly discriminating between the sets during\nblocks 3–5 after transfer.\nOne bird did show significant discrimination in these first two 100 trial\nblocks, but thereafter his d\u0004 dropped \n0 and was no longer significant during\nblocks 3–5. However, after training, all birds discriminated the AABB and\nABAB stimuli on or above criterion level.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS.

A\nnumber of interesting parallels have been identified, such as\nbabbling, audience effects, conversation-like interactions, or\ndialects, but the distribution of these phenomena is phylogenetically heterogeneous and often found in species that are not closely\nrelated to humans [3,4]. Human language is highly complex and\nnumerous characteristics appear to have no equivalent counterparts in animal communication systems. One such qualitative\ndifference concerns the morpho-syntactic organisation of language, that is, the fact that morphological and syntactic elements\nare governed by a set of language-specific rules, the source of\nmuch of the generative power of human language [5,6].\nA number of recent field studies have demonstrated meaningful\ncall combinations in the natural communication of non-human\nprimates, such as putty-nosed monkeys [7,8] or black and-white\nColobus monkeys [9,10]. Similarly, some species of birds, gibbons\nand whales have been observed to combine song elements into more\ncomplex utterances, in some cases recursively [11–14]. Birdsong in\nparticular tends to have hierarchical and non-random transitional\nstructure, and experimental change to its composition, rhythm, or\ncomponent order tends to interfere with its communicative function\n[15–19]. Despite these examples of combinatorial signalling, there are\nno good examples in animal communication studies of individuals\nacoustically modifying individual calls in patterned ways to produce\nstructurally altered vocalisations with novel meanings. In human\nspeech, however, this process is ubiquitous. Human languages rely on\nnumerous morphological processes to alter meaning, one prominent\nexample being affixation, the addition of a morpheme (the smallest\nlinguistic unit that has semantic meaning), to a word stem (the part of\nthe word that never changes), as for instance in the English word\n‘brother-hood’ [6]. Although non-human primates are able to\ndiscriminate between subtle acoustic changes in human speech\nsignals [20], it is unknown whether they also produce such acoustic\npatterns as part of their natural communication.\nSome of our previous studies with Campbell’s monkeys have\nrevealed an unusually high degree of vocal flexibility in various call\ntypes, often linked with social variables [21–25]. Females form the\ncore of a social group and interact frequently with each other both\nphysically and vocally [26]. Like other forest guenons, the single\nadult male remains spatially and socially peripheral but plays a key\nrole in predator defence and coordination of travel [27–28].\nFemales produce a range of different call types, including distress,\nthreat, contact, and warning calls [21–25; 29]. In contrast, males\nvocalise much less often and produce only a few loud call types,\nwhich function in spacing and predator defence [30]. In pilot\nobservations, we have noted subtle but seemingly consistent\nacoustic variation is some of these calls, which suggested an\naffixation-like acoustic organisation. To address this point, we\nmonitored the adult males of six wild Campbell’s monkey groups\nin the Tai Forest, three of which were fully habituated to human\nobservers. Data were collected both during the males’ responses to\nnaturally occurring disturbances and by simulating the presence of\npredators with visual and acoustic models.\nResults\nCall structure\nWe found that, in all study groups, the adult males consistently\nproduced six different loud alarm call types, ‘‘hok (Audio S1)’’,\nPLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 November 2009 | Volume 4 | Issue 11 | e7808‘‘hok-oo’’ (Audio S2), ‘‘krak’’ (Audio S3), ‘‘krak-oo’’ (Audio S4),\n‘‘wak-oo’’ (Audio S5), and ‘‘boom’’ (Audio S6), all of which were\nperceptually distinct to a human observer (fig. 1, see methods).\n‘‘Boom’’ calls were much lower pitched than the other five loud\ncalls, acoustically inflexible, always given in pairs with inter-call\nintervals of about seven seconds, and typically preceding a series of\nother loud calls [31]. The remaining five loud calls were\nacoustically more flexible. They differed from each other in the\nfrequency contour of the call stem and, crucially, in whether or not\nthe stem was trailed by an acoustically invariable ‘‘oo’’ utterance.\nIn terms of frequency contours, the ‘‘krak’’ and ‘‘krak-oo’’ calls\nwere characterised by a largely decreasing main frequency band,\n‘‘hok’’ and ‘‘hok-oo’’ calls were mainly flat, while ‘‘wak-oo’’ calls\nhad an increasing band (table 1; fig. 1).\nWe conducted a Pearson’s based Principal Component Analysis\nto spatially display the different calls (fig. 2a). The total inertia was\nFigure 1.

Crucially, this analysis did not reveal any differences\nbetween the ‘‘krak’’ call and the stem of the ‘‘krak-oo’’ call, nor\nbetween the ‘‘hok’’ call and the stem of the ‘‘hok-oo’’ call. In\naddition, these four calls could be discriminated from the ‘‘boom’’\ncall and also from the stem of the ‘‘wak-oo’’ call (fig. 2a). We then\nconducted an analysis of variance, which revealed that the six\ncalls differed significantly in the duration of the call stem\n(F 5, 1049 = 549.58; p,0.001), the start frequency of the call stem\n(F 5, 1049 = 9,199.46; p,0.001), and the transition frequency across\nthe entire call stem (F5, 1049 = 512.17; p,0.001). Tukey post hoc\ntests failed to detect any significant differences in the key\ncomparisons, that is, between the stems of ‘‘hok-oo’’ and ‘‘hok’’\nand ‘‘krak-oo’’ and ‘‘krak’’ calls (table 1).\nIf a call contained a suffix (i.e. the ‘‘oo’’ unit), it was produced\non average 0.060s following the stem, regardless of call type\n(ANOVA, df = 2, F2,573 = 0.207 p = 0.812). The ‘‘wak’’ stem was\nnever produced singly, but always followed by the ‘‘oo’’ suffix to\nform the ‘‘wak-oo’’ call. For ‘‘krak’’ and ‘‘hok’’ calls, however, the\n‘‘oo’’ suffix was optional. We then compared the acoustic structure\nof the ‘‘oo’’ units given in conjunction with the different stem calls\nand found no differences in terms of frequency or duration,\nindicating that callers produced only one acoustically invariant\nstructure in this suffixed position (table 1).\nCall context\nThe three habituated males, who were tolerant to direct\nobservations, produced their loud calls to a variety of disturbances,\nincluding both predatory and non-predatory events (table 2).\nGLM analyses, carried out with R-software, revealed that the\nproduction of the different call types varied according to context\n(main effects: context: LR Chi2 = 151.91, df = 8, p,0.0001; caller\nidentity: LR Chi2 = 17.96, df = 2, p,0.0001; call type: LR\nChi 2 = 201.08, df = 5, p,0.0001; interaction effects: context x\ncaller identity: LR Chi 2 = 8.09, df = 13, p = 0.84; context x call\ntype: LR Chi2 = 685.26, df = 40, p,0.0001; caller identity x call\ntype: LR Chi2 = 28.40, df = 10, p,0.01; context x caller identity x\ncall type: LR Chi2 = 27.65, df = 65, p = 0.99).\nSome calls were given to a broad, others to a narrow range of\nevents. Crucially, ‘‘krak’’ calls were exclusively given after\ndetecting a leopard, suggesting that it functioned as a leopard\nalarm call, whereas the ‘‘krak-oo’’ was given to almost any\ndisturbance, suggesting it functioned as a general alert call.\nSimilarly, ‘‘hok’’ calls were almost exclusively associated with the\npresence of a crowned eagle (either a real eagle attack or in\nresponse to another monkey’s eagle alarm calls), while ‘‘hok-oo’’\ncalls were given to a range of disturbances within the canopy,\nincluding the presence of an eagle or a neighbouring group (whose\npresence could sometimes be inferred by the vocal behaviour of\nthe females). On a few occasions, ‘‘hok’’ and ‘‘hok-oo’’ calls were\nproduced in response to a flying squirrel, whose silhouette\nsomewhat resembles a flying eagle, but never to any other large\nbird.\nWhile producing ‘‘hok-oo’’ calls, males adopted a threat\nposture, combined with flashing their eyelids, and they sometimes\nconducted a short dash towards the disturbance. Although direct\nbehavioural observations were only possible in 33.7% of calling\nevents (N = 3 males; N = 83 events), we suspect that this kind of\nthreat behaviour was common in conjunction with this call. None\nof the other calls was associated with such distinct behaviour, apart\nfrom ‘‘boom’’ calls that involved inflating the vocal sacs. Adding\nan ‘‘oo’’ unit to ‘‘hok’’, thus, indicated that the male was\naggressively motivated, and this was usually in response to a\ngeneral disturbance that took place within the canopy, particularly\na perched eagle or a conspecific opponent. ‘‘Wak-oo’’ calls were\ngiven to the same events as ‘‘hok-oo’’ calls (eagles, other flying\nanimals, Diana monkey eagle alarms), but for some reason never\nto neighbours. ‘‘Boom’’ calls, finally, were only given to nonpredatory contexts, such as a falling branch or tree, to initiate or\nhalt group travel [see ref. 7], during disputes with neighbours, and\nduring any unusual vocal excitation within the group (table 2).\nTo investigate the predator warning function more directly, we\nperformed a series of field experiments that simulated the presence\nof the different predators, using both visual and acoustic models.\nTable 1.

Detecting a predator\nnever triggered any ‘‘boom’’ calls. In contrast, the general alert call\n‘‘krak-oo’’ was given in all four conditions, whereas ‘‘krak’’ calls\nwere only produced in the presence of leopards. ‘‘Wak-oo’’ calls\nwere given to eagles, while ‘‘hok’’ and ‘‘hok-oo’’ calls were\nprimarily given to visual eagle models (table 3). General linear\nmodel analyses of variance revealed that the call rates of the\ndifferent call types were significantly affected by the predator type,\nand by whether the caller could see the predator (table 4).\nDiscussion\nWe carried out long-term observations and predator model\nexperiments to investigate how free-ranging male Campbell’s\nmonkeys of Taı ̈ National Park, Ivory Coast, communicated about\nexternal events. In previous research, we found that males and\nfemales produced different alarm calls that, in some cases, were\ncombined into meaningful sequences [23,31-34]. Here, we were\ninterested in how acoustically flexible males were with some of\ntheir alarm call types, and how they applied this variation to\nexternal events. Our study showed that male Campbell’s monkeys\nproduced six different loud alarm calls in response to disturbing or\ndangerous events. ‘‘Boom’’ calls were acoustically and contextually\nunique, whereas the other five calls shared a number of acoustic\nfeatures. The most relevant finding was that these five calls\nconsisted of a call stem that differed in terms of the basic frequency\ncontours and could be followed by an optional suffix-like small and\ninconspicuous vocal unit, which altered the semantic content of\nthe full call in significant and predictable ways.\nOne important contrast between human and non-human\nprimate vocal behaviour concerns the degree of motor control\nindividuals have during call production. Humans are able to\ncontrol their larynx and vocal tracts rapidly and precisely by\nmeans of various articulators, including tongue, mandible, and lips\n[35,36]. The same basic mechanisms also play a role during vocal\nproduction in non-human primates, as illustrated by studies with\nDiana monkeys and other non-human primates [37–40]. Our\nFigure 2.

We also\nconducted some pilot experiments during which we played back\n‘‘hok-oo’’ and ‘‘krak-oo’’ calls to different groups of Diana\nmonkeys, which often associate with Campbell’s monkeys. As\npredicted, none of the tested Diana monkey groups showed any\nkind of significant anti-predator responses in these playbacks, in\nstark contrast to when hearing the non-suffixed Campbell’s\nmonkey alarm calls [31; unpublished data). We concluded that\nthe Campbell’s monkey alarm call system goes significantly\nbeyond what has been described so far in the animal communication literature where acoustic diversity is normally achieved by\nmodifications of frequency patterns, call rates, intensity differences, or sequential organisation [6], but not by suffixation.\nThe degree to which callers possess active control over their\nacoustic products is difficult to assess and it is also not clear what\nsocial factors influence call production in Campbell’s monkeys and\nother primates. In blue monkeys, field experiments have shown\nthat callers appear to take into account the degree to which other\ngroup members are at risk during eagle presence [41] and there is\na growing literature of other types of audience effects that govern\nprimate vocal behaviour. However, despite these results, it is still\nlargely unclear whether non-human primates intentionally inform\ntheir audience about the event they have just experienced, or\nwhether their vocal response is more directly driven by the\npsychological processes triggered by external events, the currently\nprevailing hypothesis. What our results show is that callers appear\nto make some judgements about the nature of the event (tree fall,\ngroup gathering to travel, conspecific intruder, eagle, leopard), and\nthat this assessment determines whether or not affixation takes\nplace. Equally important, male Campbell’s monkeys rarely\nproduce single calls but almost always give sequences of different\ncall types [31]. Further research will have to address the role that\naffixation plays in these calling sequences in terms of contextspecificity and whether listeners are able to comprehend the\nrelationships between event and corresponding call sequence.\nMaterials and Methods\nThe study was conducted in the Taı ̈ National Park (5u509N,\n7u21W), Ivory Cost, the largest remaining block of intact rainforest\nin West Africa. Data were collected between January 2006 and\nSeptember 2007 on two groups of Campbell’s monkeys (Cercopithecus c. campbelli) that were fully habituated to the presence of\nhuman observers. Campbell’s monkeys routinely form polyspecific\ngroups with other primates, particularly Diana monkeys, which\nwhom they spend 77–89% of their time during feeding, travelling\nand resting [29]. Campbell’s monkeys live in small one-male\ngroups with 3–7 adult females with their offspring [23]. The two\nstudy groups have been followed on a regular basis since the early\n1990s and all individuals can be recognised individually. We had\nTable 3.

During the study period, we observed one\nreplacement of the single adult male in one habituated group. The\nnew male became quickly habituated to human observers, which\neffectively increased the sample size of habituated individuals to\nN = 3.\nBehavioural observations consisted of 15-min focal animal\nsampling and all-occurrence sampling. Three habituated males\nserved as focal animal samples for a total of 40 hours (Male 1:\n14 hours over 11 months, Male 2: 6 hours over 7 months; Male 3:\n20 hours over 16 months). All occurrence sampling generated a\ntotal of about 2,000 observation hours, which lead to a total\nsample of 1,067 calls of acceptable acoustic quality for subsequent\nquantitative analyses. Under both data collection regimes, the\nobserver (KO) recorded all vocalisations, the associated behaviour\n(travel, forage, rest, groom, aggression), and any unusual event\nimmediately preceding a vocalisation, such as the presence of a\nleopard or crowned eagle, the calls of a neighbouring male, the\nthundering sound of a falling tree or large branch, the alarm calls\nof a nearby Diana monkey male to an eagle or terrestrial\ndisturbance [33], the sudden appearance of an aerial or terrestrial\nnon-predatory animal, or an unusually high rate of contact calls by\nfemale and juvenile group members. We also scored all events that\ndirectly followed a male call, particularly assemblies of dispersed\ngroup members or group travel.\nEncounters with real predators were rare (N = 3 for leopards,\nPanthera pardus; and N = 11 for crowned eagle, Stephanoaetus\ncoronatus) and we therefore conducted a series of field experiments\nduring which we presented predator models, either by positioning\na visual replica of the two main predators, or by broadcasting their\ntypical vocalisations through a loudspeaker [8]. All seven different\nmales were tested (3 habituated ones, 4 from the semi-habituated\ngroups). Each male was exposed to a particular stimulus only once\nand the order of presentation of the different stimuli was\nrandomised for each male. Before an experiment was carried\nout the following conditions had to be met: (a) the observer had to\nbe in contact with the group for at least 30 min during which no\nalarm calls were produced; (b) the predator model (or playback\nspeaker) had to be positioned by a field assistant on the projected\ntravelling route. For eagle trials, the model or loudspeaker was\npositioned 2–3m off the ground. For leopard trials, it was\npositioned on the ground. Eagle shrieks were recorded in the\nstudy area by KZ; leopard growls were purchased from the\nNational Sound Archive, London (see 33 for spectrographic\nillustrations of the playback stimuli). The same visual models\n(stuffed leopard or crowned eagle) and sound stimuli were used for\nall tests. All acoustic stimuli were broadcast with a SONY\nWMD6C Walkman connected to NAGRA DSM speakeramplifier so that calls sounded natural and could be clearly heard\nat a distance of about 20 m. The observer then walked with the\ngroup and recorded the male’s behaviour. Vocal responses were\nrecorded using a SONY TCD–D100 DAT Walkman, a\nSENNHEISER ME88 microphone, and a LAVALIER microphone for observer comments.\nAll calls were digitised at a sampling rate of 44.1 kHz, 16 bits\naccuracy, using Raven 1.3 software, to extract basic measurements, such as the duration and the frequency at which the highest\nspectral amplitude occurred at the beginning and end of the call\nunit. We then performed a Pearson’s Principal Component\nAnalysis on the entire data set (N = 1,067 calls) to investigate the\nclustering of the different call stems on the basis of their basic\nacoustic parameters, i.e. duration, start frequency, and transition\nfrequency. Transition frequency was calculated by subtracting the\nstart from the end frequency of the call stem (fig. 1). To explore the\nnature of the acoustic differences between the different call types,\nwe conducted analyses of variance, followed by Tukey multiple\ncomparisons post hoc tests, for five major uncorrelated acoustic\nvariables. Caller identity was treated as a random factor. To\nexplore the relation between the different call types and contexts\n(naturalistic observations and predator simulation experiments),\nwe used generalised linear models (Poisson error structure with log\nlink function, type III; likelihood ratios followed by chi-square\ntests). For naturalistic observations, the dependent variable was the\nnumber of calls produced of each type per male and event\ncategory with several occurrences of each event category per male.\nFor the predator experiments, we examined both the effects of\npredator type and the modality of detection.\nIn a final analysis, we were interested in how reliable human\nobservers can discriminate the different call types by ear. For this\npurpose, KO selected a large sample of the original all-occurrence\ndatabase of the habituated males (N = 877 calls, the remaining\n17.8% of the entire dataset were excluded because of substandard\nrecording quality). All sound files were anonymised before\nclassification. The procedure was conducted three times on\nseparate days. Classification of the six call types was highly\naccurate (reliabilities: 96% between day 1 and 2; 96% between day\n1 and 3, and 98% between day 2 and 3), demonstrating that\nhumans can discriminate these six call types very reliably.\nSupporting Information\nAudio S1 ‘‘Hok’’ calls are almost exclusively associated with\ncrowned eagle presence.\nFound at: doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0007808.s001 (0.05 MB\nWAV)\nAudio S2 ‘‘Hok-oo’’ are given to a range of disturbances within\nthe canopy, including eagles, the presence of neighbouring groups\nand, on a few occasions, to a flying squirrel.

Here, we\npresent the results of a long-term study on Campbell’s monkeys,\nwhich has revealed an unrivaled degree of vocal complexity. Adult\nmales produced six different loud call types, which they combined\ninto various sequences in highly context-specific ways. We found\nstereotyped sequences that were strongly associated with cohesion and travel, falling trees, neighboring groups, nonpredatory\nanimals, unspecific predatory threat, and specific predator classes.\nWithin the responses to predators, we found that crowned eagles\ntriggered four and leopards three different sequences, depending\non how the caller learned about their presence. Callers followed a\nnumber of principles when concatenating sequences, such as\nnonrandom transition probabilities of call types, addition of specific calls into an existing sequence to form a different one, or\nrecombination of two sequences to form a third one. We conclude\nthat these primates have overcome some of the constraints of\nlimited vocal control by combinatorial organization. As the different sequences were so tightly linked to specific external events, the\nCampbell’s monkey call system may be the most complex example\nof ‘proto-syntax’ in animal communication known to date.\nalarm call \u0001 nonhuman primate \u0001 referential communication \u0001\nsemantic \u0001 syntax\nOne way of studying language evolution is to compare the\ncommunicative abilities of humans and animals. Parallels\nwith human language can be found at various levels, both in\nterms of production and comprehension. Particularly relevant\nare cases of social influences on vocal development (1), cases of\ninfant babbling (2), and other types of vocal learning (3–5). In\nsome species, there is evidence for population-wide convergence\neffects in the form of culturally transmitted dialects [e.g., starlings (6), whales (7), and Japanese macaques (8)]. In terms of\npragmatic use, there is good evidence that call production can be\ninfluenced by specific audiences (9, 10). In terms of comprehension, primates and possibly many other species are able to\nassign meaning to different calls if there is a strong relation\nbetween a call’s acoustic morphology and its eliciting context\n(11–14). In some species, there is some evidence for hemispheric\nspecialization when processing conspecific calls [e.g., horses (15),\nCampbell’s monkeys (16), rhesus macaques (17), starlings (18),\nand sea lions (19)].\nDespite all this evidence, there is currently a wide consensus\nthat human language differs from animal communication in a\nprofound way, because the essence of human language is its\ncomplex grammatical organization, something that is widely\nlacking in all animal communication systems (20–22). Despite\nconsiderable effort devoted to the topic, the evolutionary origins\nof this key property of language have remained relatively elusive\n(23). This is not to say that animal communication does not\nfollow certain combinatorial principles. Gibbons, whales, and\nsongbirds, for example, combine finite and stereotyped sound\nelements to form more complicated structures (1, 24–27). In\nsome cases, these structures possess hierarchical organization,\nalthough very little is known about the relationship between\nacoustic structure and communicative function. A typical finding\nis that if the structure of a sequence is artificially altered, for\nexample by changing the composition or order of elements, the\nsignal tends to loose its communicative function (28–30). Another relevant point is that nonhuman primates are perfectly\ncapable of discriminating human speech composed in different\nways [e.g., tamarins (31)] and of comprehending simplified\nnonverbal forms of human syntax [e.g., apes (32–35)].\nIn natural contexts, spontaneous call combinations have also\nbeen observed in nonhuman primates, although there are only a\nsmall number of examples. Chimpanzees combine some of their\ncalls in nonrandom ways, although the communicative function\nof these combinations remains to be investigated (36). Bonobos\nproduce five acoustically distinct call types in response to\ndifferent foods, with a predictable relationship between the\ncaller’s food preference and the relative frequency of the different calls (37). In putty-nosed monkeys, adult males produce\ntwo loud calls, ‘‘pyows’’ and ‘‘hacks,’’ in a range of contexts,\nincluding predation. However, when combining the two calls in\none specific way (i.e., a few pyows followed by a few hacks), males\ngive a supplementary message to their group members to move\naway from the current location (38, 39). In chickadees, songs\ncontain C and D notes, which encode different information,\nwhile the number and acoustic variation of D notes provides\nsupporting information about the size and dangerousness of a\npredator (40, 41). During social interactions, animals hear call\ncombinations even more often, especially when individuals\nexchange vocalizations during social interactions. Playback experiments have shown that baboons recognize individual callers\nand respond to the combinations of calls produced by them,\nrather than the individual calls, and extract meaning from them\n(42, 43).\nThe vocal behavior of female Campbell’s monkeys is relatively\nwell studied, particularly in captivity, and has revealed considerable socially determined acoustic plasticity (5, 44–47). Adult\nmale Campbell’s monkeys very rarely participate in the various\ncall exchanges that take place within the group, but instead\nproduce a range of loud and low-pitched calls that carry over\nlarge distances, much beyond the immediate group distribution\n(48, 49). These calls are usually given to serious disturbances and\nin sequences, some of which have been described in earlier\nresearch (49–51). For instance, Gautier and Gautier-Hion (48)\nsuggested that hack sequences functioned as predator signals\nwhile ‘‘boom-hack’’ sequences functioned in spatial coordination. Zuberbu¨hler (49) confirmed experimentally that artificially\nAuthor contributions: K.O., A.L., and K.Z. designed research; K.O. performed research; K.O.,\nA.L., and K.Z. analyzed data; and K.O., A.L., and K.Z. wrote the paper.\nThe authors declare no conflict of interest.\nThis article is a PNAS Direct Submission.\n1To whom correspondence may be addressed.

Recently, we have found that the hacks were\nan acoustically heterogeneous class of vocalizations, which could\nbe categorized into five structurally and contextually different\ncall types (‘‘krak,’’ ‘‘hok,’’ ‘‘krak-oo,’’ ‘‘hok-oo,’’ and ‘‘wak-oo’’)\n(50) (Fig. 1). This subtle acoustic diversity is achieved by\nfrequency transitions and an optional suffixation principle,\nwhich increases the males’ call type repertoire considerably.\nHere, we studied the alarm calling behavior of free-ranging\nCampbell’s monkey males in natural and experimental predator\nsituations. We were particularly interested in how males concatenated their repertoire of six call types into call sequences. To\nthis end, we sought to describe the principles governing the\norganization of sequences in terms of composition and call order\nand how the different sequences related to external events.\nResults\nCall Sequences in Nonpredation Contexts.In nonpredation contexts,\nwe recorded three distinct call sequence types, (i) a pair of\n‘‘boom’’ calls (B) given alone, (ii) a pair of boom calls followed\nby a series of krak-oo (K\u0001), and (iii) a pair of boom calls, followed\nby a series of K\u0001 calls, with one to several hok-oo (H\u0001) calls\ninterspersed (Table 1 and Fig. 2).\nThe first sequence type, unaccompanied pairs of boom calls, was\nnot very common, although we managed to record this sequence\nfrom seven males (n  13 events).When producing unaccompanied\npairs of boom calls, the common finding was that the male was not\nin visual contact with the group, usually some 30–50 m away (12 of\n13 events). Campbell’s males prefer peripheral positions within the\ngroup where they remain in visual contact with at least one group\nmember (average distance between the male and the nearest\nfemale: 4.80  0.61 m; n  10 per male; four habituated males). We\nobserved that, immediately after this boom call sequence, the group\noften progressed toward the male (8 of 13 events), similar to\nprevious findings in putty-nosed monkeys (39). More detailed\nobservations were possible for the four habituated males. In 10 of\n13 instances of unaccompanied pairs of booms, the group traveled\nfor unusually long distances of \u0004100 m during the next 30 min at\na speed significantly higher than normal (\u00041 m/min; determined by\nmatched samples collected at the same time of day without male\ncalling; Mann–Whitney U test: N1  N2  10, Z  1.96, P \u0005 0.05).\nThe second sequence type consisted of a pair of boom calls\nfollowed by a K\u0001 sequence (median overall  10 calls; range:\n4–15 calls: n  53; Fig. 2). This combined sequence, recorded\nfrom all four habituated males, was mainly given to falling trees\nor branches with no other noticeable disturbance (85%). In the\nremaining cases (15%), the sequence was given in response to\nfights between other monkey species in the canopy, although this\nusually led to branches falling as well.\nThe third sequence also consisted of a pair of boom calls\nfollowed by a K\u0001 sequence (overall median  12 calls; range:\n9–16 calls; n  76), but here the sequence was interspersed with\n1–7 H\u0001 calls (Fig. 2). This combined sequence was recorded\nfrom all four habituated males and two semihabituated groups\nand always in response to neighboring Campbell’s monkey\ngroups or single stranger males, suggesting that it functioned in\nterritorial defense. To further test this hypothesis, we investigated whether the location of call production varied in systematic\nTable 1.

We predicted that sequences given in the periphery of a\ngroup’s home range contained significantly more H\u0001 calls than\nsequences given in the center, which turned out to be the case\n(Fig. 3; Fisher’s exact test, P \u0005 0.001).\nA fourth vocal pattern in nonpredation contexts was the\nproduction of single isolated K\u0001 calls (n  9; three habituated\nmales). This always happened when a male was startled by\nsudden movements of a nonpredatory animal, such as a duiker,\nflying squirrel, or a human observer.\nCall Sequences in Predation Contexts. In predation contexts, which\nis when monkeys interacted with leopards or crowned eagles, we\nrecorded a more diverse range of call sequence types (Table 1\nand Fig. 2).\nGeneral Predator Alert. A first sequence, recorded from all four\nhabituated males and one semihabituated male, consisted of K\u0001\ncalls only (median  15 calls; range: 3–25; n  18; Fig. 2). This\nsequence was rare and given to any auditory sign of a predator,\ntypically after hearing Diana monkey alarm calls (n  15/18) or,\nmore rarely (n  3/18), after hearing predator vocalizations, but\nnever to any visual signs of a predator.\nCrowned Eagle Alarm. The majority of call sequences to crowned\neagles were composed of wak-oo (W\u0001) and krak-oo (K\u0001) calls,\nsometimes with the addition of hok (H) and hok-oo (H\u0001) calls\n(median  25 calls; range: 15 to 40; n  38; Fig. 2). By analyzing\nin more details the sequences produced by the three most\nhabituated males, we found that high levels of urgency were\nassociated with a high proportion of H and H\u0001 calls in the\nsequence. There was a significant difference in the proportion of\nH and H\u0001 calls if the caller spotted a real eagle or encountered\nthe eagle model compared to when he only heard eagle vocalizations or Diana monkey eagle alarm calls (Fisher’s exact test,\nP \u0005 0.001; Fig. 4A).\nLeopard Alarms. Call sequences to leopards were always composed of krak (K) calls, sometimes combined with krak-oo (K\u0001)\ncalls (median  21 calls; range: 12–35; n  26; Fig. 2). In the\nsequences recorded from the three most habituated males, we\nfound that the level of urgency was associated with a high\nproportion of K calls in the sequence.

The different call sequences were not\nrandomly assembled but ordered in specific ways, with entire\nsequences serving as units to build more complicated sequences.\nAs mentioned, pairs of booms alone instigate group movements\ntoward the calling male, while K\u0001 series functioned as general\nalarm calls. If combined, the resulting sequence carried an\nentirely different meaning, by referring to falling wood. In all\ncases, the booms preceded the K\u0001 series. We also found that\nanother sequence, the H\u0001 series, could be added to boom–K\u0001\nsequences, something that callers did when detecting a neighboring group. H\u0001 series were never given by themselves.\nNonpredation events were characterized by the production of\ntwo boom calls, which could be given alone (to indicate group\nmovement) or which could introduce subsequent calls (100%,\nn  142 cases, all eight males). In response to tree falls, the\nbooms preceded a series of K\u0001 calls. In response to neighbors,\nthe booms preceded a series of H\u0001 calls, followed by a series of\nK\u0001 calls. In some cases, callers inserted a single K\u0001 call between\nthe booms and H\u0001 call series. Interestingly, these insertions were\nonly heard in group 1, both by the first male and also by his\nsuccessor (males 1 and 2), but never in group 2 (i.e., males 3 and\n4). Although we only have data from four males, it is possible that\nthe particular way by which the K\u0001 and H\u0001 calls are concatenated was an identifying specific feature of group 1. We never\nheard this particular insertion in the semihabituated groups.\nAnother unexpected difference was that both immigrant males\nproduced significantly more H\u0001 calls (males 2 and 4; median\n5; range: 1–7; n  36) than their predecessors (males 1 and 3;\nmedian  2; range: 1–5; n  40; Mann–Whitney U tests, Z\n5.33, P \u0005 0.001).\nTo leopards, males sometimes produced pure K sequences\n(n  9/26), but if K\u0001 calls were added, then typically toward the\nend of the sequence. We compared the number of K and K\u0001 calls\nin the first and second half of the sequences and found a\nsignificant difference (Fisher’s exact test, P \u0005 0.001). To crowned\neagles, most sequences began with a series of H (16 of 38\nsequences) and typically ended with a series of K\u0001 (36 of 38\nsequences). This specific order probably reflected the decrease\nin urgency or threat perceived by the caller. If W\u0001 or H\u0001 were\nproduced, then they appeared more or less randomly throughout\nthe sequence without any detectable patterns, while H and K\u0001\nfollowed the ordering outlined before. There was a significant\ndifference between the number of H and K\u0001 at the beginning\nand at the end of sequences (Fisher’s exact test, P \u0005 0.001; n\n38), which had the effect that the distribution patterns differed\nsignificantly between the four call types (\u00012 test X2  311.3;\nDL  21; P \u0005 0.001).\nDiscussion\nIn earlier work, we have shown that Campbell’s monkey males\nuse an affixation rule to increase the size of their call repertoire.\nAdding the suffix ‘‘oo’’ to krak (K 3 K\u0001) or hok (H 3 H\u0001) calls\naltered these calls’ meanings in predictable ways (50). Here, we\ndescribe regularities at another level, i.e., in how monkeys\ncombined this repertoire of six call types into nine distinct call\nsequences (Fig. 2). These call combinations were not random,\nbut the product of a number of principles, which governed how\nsemantic content was obtained.\nWe found five main principles that governed these relationships. First, callers produced sequences composed of calls that\nalready carried narrow meanings (e.g., K  leopard; H\ncrowned eagle) (49, 50, 52). In these instances, sequence and call\nmeanings were identical. Second, callers produced meaningful\nsequences, but used calls with unspecific meanings (e.g., K\u0001\npredator). Third, callers combined two meaningful sequences\ninto a more complex one with a different meaning (e.g., B \u0001 K\u0001\n falling wood). Fourth, callers added meaningless calls to an\nalready meaningful sequence and, in doing so, changed its\nmeaning (e.g., B \u0001 K\u0001 \u0001 H\u0001  neighbors). Fifth, callers added\nmeaningful calls to an already meaningful sequence and, in doing\nso, refined its meaning (e.g., K \u0001 K\u0001  leopard; W\u0001 \u0001 K\u0001\ncrowned eagle). We also found regularities in terms of call order.\nBoom calls, indicative of a nonpredation context, always preceded any other call types. H and K calls, indicators of crowned\neagles or leopards, were always produced early in the sequence\nand were relatively more numerous if the level of threat was high.\nIn forest guenons, the single adult male of the group mainly\nvocalizes in response to predators and other significant external\ndisturbances (5, 48, 53). Females are vocally active in social\nsituations (44–46) and to predators to which they produce a\ndiverse alarm call repertoire that encodes information about\npredator type and level of threat (47). Whether Campbell’s\nmonkeys produced these calls to intentionally inform others\nabout the event they have experienced cannot be decided with\nour data. Some observations suggest not. For example, it is\npuzzling that males produce loud calls in response to the\nthundering sound of falling trees, as all other group members will\nhave perceived the event as well. The collapse of a large tree\nprovides a significant danger to arboreal animals and fatalities\nare not unusual. Thus, calling males may have the urge to\nadvertise their uninjured state and provide an acoustic focal\npoint for scattered or disoriented group members, rather than\nattempting to inform others about the danger.\nW+ / K+\nH / H+\nK\nK+\n*** ***\nA Eagle B Leopard\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n1 234\nMean N calls per sequence (%)\nMean N calls per sequence (%)\nFig. 4.

PNAS \u0001 December 22, 2009 \u0001 vol. 106 \u0001 no. 51 \u0001 22029\nPSYCHOLOGICAL AND\nCOGNITIVE SCIENCES\nANTHROPOLOGY\nDownloaded from https://www.pnas.org by UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND; MCKELDIN LIBRARY on January 13, 2026 from IP address 129.2.89.26.\nThe core finding of this study is that the different calls\nproduced by the males were usually given as part of structurally\nunique sequences and in context-specific ways. Context could be\ndescribed in terms of event type, degree of threat, spatial\nrelations within the group, and group movements. Some of these\nfunctions have already been shown for other guenons, particularly Diana monkeys (54) and putty-nosed monkeys (38, 39), but\nno previous study has revealed such a rich portfolio of contextspecific calling behavior. In earlier playback experiments, series\nof H and K calls were meaningful to Diana monkeys, as these\ncalls elicited their own corresponding eagle or leopard alarm\ncalls (49). If artificially combined with pairs of B, however, Diana\nmonkeys no longer responded to the H or K sequences, suggesting that this was due to the boom’s indication of a nonpredatory event. Although we have not found any natural B–H or B–K\nsequences in this study, we have recorded B–K\u0001 sequences,\nsuggesting that the Diana monkeys transferred the principle ‘‘B\ncancels predation meaning’’ to different combinations. An obvious next step would be to conduct systematic playback experiments in which the communicative functions of various call\ncombinations are tested experimentally.\nWhen comparing human language to primate communication\nsystems, such as this one, a number of interesting similarities and\nfundamental differences emerge. First, male Campbell’s monkeys are limited to a relatively small range of messages that they\ncan convey to their audience. This is partly because callers do not\ntake full advantage of the potential of their communicative\nsystem. For example, they do not inverse the order of calls (e.g.,\nAB to BA) to generate differences in meaning, and a large\nnumber of other possible call combinations are not realized.\nSecond, human language is symbolic in the sense that signalers\ncan inform listeners about referents that are not physically\npresent (55). In Campbell’s monkeys, we only observed calling in\nresponse to real life experiences, and some observations suggested that callers did not attempt to inform others. Further\nresearch will have to test whether some of the observed contingencies between acoustic morphology and external events were\nintentionally produced or biproducts of other processes. Whatever the outcome, our results demonstrate that the evolution of\ncomplex morphology has begun early in primate evolution, long\nbefore the emergence of hominids, and hence preceded the\nevolution of intentional communication.\nAre these results relevant for understanding the evolution of\nsyntax? As outlined before, this system pales in contrast to the\ncommunicative power of grammar; using calls in different\nsequences, even highly predictable sequences, is not the same as\ngrammar. Nevertheless, the call sequences observed in this\nprimate were not the results of individuals responding to serial\nor compound stimuli (such as ‘‘water’’ and ‘‘bird’’ combined to\n‘‘waterbird’’). In Campbell’s monkeys, the different sequences\nwere given to highly discrete external events with very little\nconceptual similarities.\nThe degree to which the communication system found in\nCampbell’s monkey is unique or a general feature of primate\ncommunication is currently unknown. We suspect the latter,\nespecially for forest primates whose vocal skills must have been\nunder considerable pressure by natural selection due to high\nlevels of predation and low levels of visibility in their dim\nhabitats. The lack of articulatory control, which characterizes\nnonhuman primates, may have favored the evolution of combinatorial signaling.\nMaterials and Methods\nStudy Site and Subjects. The study site, a system of trails covering an area of\n\u000425 km2, is located in the Taï National Park (5 °50\u0007N, 7 °21W), Ivory Coast, the\nlargest protected block of rainforest in West Africa. The study lasted from\nJanuary 2006 to September 2007 and has been approved by the relevant\ngovernment institution of Ivory Coast (Office Ivoirien des Parcs et Re´serves).\nAll data were collected from two habituated and four semihabituated groups\nof Campbell’s monkeys (Cercopithecus campbelli campbelli). These forest\nguenons form one-male groups with three to seven adult females and five to\nseven juveniles and infants. We observed two male takeovers in both habituated groups during the study, which increased the number of focal animals\nto four habituated males (group 1, male 1 was replaced by male 2 in December\n2006; group 2, male 3 was replaced by male 4 in April 2007). It is possible that\nsuch takeovers also took place in the semihabituated groups, but because we\nwere unable to individually identify any group members, we assumed that\neach group had the same male throughout the study period.\nData Collection. Observations were conducted in 15-min blocks under a focal\nanimal sampling regime (56) between 08:00 and 17:00 GMT. During each\nobservation period, the observer (K.O.) recorded all loud calls produced by the\nfocal male. The single adult male is the only one to produce loud calls in\nthe group, so there was no risk of confusion in terms of caller identification.\nIf the male produced a loud call, the observer determined its likely cause\namong the following: (i) predator, presence of a leopard (Panthera pardus) or\ncrowned eagle (Stephanoaetus coronatus); (ii) intergroup, presence of neighboring group (usually inferred by loud calls of their adult male); (iii) tree/\nbranch, crashing sound of falling tree or large branch; (iv) monkey alarm,\nDiana monkey eagle or leopard alarm calls (54); and (v) cohesion and travel,\nmale spatially separated far from the group (\u000530–50 m) or beginning of group\ntravel after spatial separation.\nThe four habituated males were directly observed in dense forest vegetation for a total focal duration of 43 h (male 1, 11 months; male 2, 6 months;\nmale 3, 15 months; male 4, 2 months). Scan animal samples (n  4,425) were\ncollected every 30 min, during which we recorded (i) the presence of other\nmonkey species and (ii) the location within the group’s home range. We also\ncollected ad libitum samples from all habituated and semihabituated groups\nduring \u00042,000 h total contact time. This enabled us notably to report on the\nresponse of males to their main predators, leopards (n  3) and crowned\neagles (n  11).\nPredator Experiments. As encounters with real predators were rare, we conducted a series of field experiments during which we presented predator\nmodels to the different males, either by positioning a visual replica of the\npredator or by broadcasting recordings of typical predator vocalizations\n(leopard growls, eagle shrieks). A custom-made eagle model and a custommade leopard model were used for all experiments. Both manipulations have\nbeen used successfully before in other studies to simulate predator presence\n(e.g., 47, 54). We tested each of the four stimuli 10 times; that is, 40 trials total,\non seven different males. The four semihabituated males were tested only\nonce per stimulus category. Some of the habituated males were tested more\nthan once, with subsequent trials spaced by at least 2 months (N leopard\nmodel; N eagle model; N eagle playback; N leopard playback: male 1  3/2/3/2;\nmale 2  1/2/1/1; male 3  2/2/2/3; male 4 was never tested as he arrived toward\nthe end of the study).\nBefore each experiment, the following conditions had to be met: (i) the\nstudy group was aware of the presence of human observers for at least 30 min;\n(ii) no alarm calls were produced for at least 30 min; (iii) the predator model\n(or playback speaker) was positioned ahead of the group’s estimated travel\ndirection ensuring that no associated monkey species could detect it first. One\nobserver (K.O.) and one field assistant were necessary for these experiments.\nThe observer walked with the group and recorded the male’s behavior, while\nthe assistant operated the predator model. For eagle trials, the model or\nloudspeaker was positioned at an elevation of 2–3 m off the ground. For\nleopard trials, the model or loudspeaker was positioned on the ground. Eagle\nshrieks were recorded in the study area; leopard growls were purchased from\nthe National Sound Archives, London. All acoustic stimuli were broadcast with\na Sony WMD6C Professional Walkman connected to NAGRA DSM speakeramplifier with the amplitude level adjusted so that the calls sounded natural\nand could be clearly heard by the group.\nWithin the predator context, we discriminated between degrees of urgency (i.e., likelihood of an attack) and compared the composition of sequences. Low-urgency situations were when the presence of a predator was\nrevealed by acoustic cues (playback of predator calls, alarm calls by Diana\nmonkeys); high-urgency situations were when the predator was visible (predator models; real predator encounters). This distinction was based on the\nresults of another experimental study with forest African primates, which\nshowed that call intensity was higher when a predator was detected in the\nvisual than the acoustic domain (57).\n22030 \u0001 www.pnas.orgcgidoi10.1073pnas.0908118106 Ouattara et al.\nDownloaded from https://www.pnas.org by UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND; MCKELDIN LIBRARY on January 13, 2026 from IP address 129.2.89.26.\nCall Recordings and Analyses. All vocal responses were recorded using a\nSony TCD-D100 DAT Walkman, a Sennheiser ME88 microphone, and a\nLavalier microphone for additional observer comments. All calls were\ndigitized at a sampling rate of 44.1 kHz with 16 bits accuracy. A total of 224\nmale calling events were collected. In a previous study, we were able to\nreliably distinguish six different loud call types according to their acoustic\nstructure: Boom (B), hok (H), krak (K), krak-oo (K\u0001), hok-oo (H\u0001), and\nwak-oo (W\u0001) (50) (Fig. 1). Krak-oo and krak and hok-oo and hok calls were\nidentical, apart from the optional -oo suffix. Krak-oo calls could be emitted\nsingly; all other calls were given as part sequences of two or more calls. We\ndetermined the composition of each call sequence and related them to the\neliciting context. To this end, we (i) identified all call types in the sequence,\n(ii) calculated the total number of each type produced, and (iii) determined\nthe positioning of each call type in the sequence. Statistical analyses were\nconducted using the Statistica software package, using mainly nonparametric procedures.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS.

In vervets, there is a close and direct relationship between the production of\ndistinct alarm vocalizations and the presence of distinct predator types. Recent fieldwork has however\nrevealed the use of several additional alarm calling systems in primates. Here, the authors describe\nplayback studies on the alarm call system of two colobine species, the King colobus (Colobus polykomos)\nof Taı ̈ Forest, Ivory Coast, and the Guereza colobus (C. guereza) of Budongo Forest, Uganda. Both\nspecies produce two basic alarm call types, snorts and acoustically variable roaring phrases, when\nconfronted with leopards or crowned eagles. Neither call type is given exclusively to one predator, but\nthe authors found strong regularities in call sequencing. Leopards typically elicited sequences consisting\nof a snort followed by few phrases, while eagles typically elicited sequences with no snorts and many\nphrases. The authors discuss how these call sequences have the potential to encode information at\ndifferent levels, such as predator type, response-urgency, or the caller’s imminent behavior.\nKeywords: Colobus polykomos, Colobus guereza, alarm calls, predation, referential signaling\nPredation is an important evolutionary force that has selected for\na wide variety of antipredator tactics (Lima & Dill, 1990; Stanford,\n1995, 1998). One regularly employed by many species is the\nproduction of vocal signals upon detecting a predator. These\nsignals can function in predator (or “pursuit”) deterrence (Woodland, Jaafar, & Knight, 1980; Zuberbu ̈hler, Jenny, & Bshary, 1999)\nand to warn conspecifics about the type of threat present (Seyfarth,\nCheney, & Marler, 1980; Struhsaker, 1967; Zuberbu ̈hler, 2005).\nThe classic example for conspecific warning is demonstrated by\nvervet monkeys, which produce acoustically different alarm calls\nfor different predator classes (Seyfarth et al., 1980; Struhsaker,\n1967). Subsequent research has shown that the ability to produce\nacoustically distinct alarm calls to different types of predators,\nusually aerial and ground predators, could be widespread in the\nanimal kingdom (e.g., chickens: Evans, Evans, & Marler, 1993;\nsciurids: Slobodchikoff, Kiriazis, Fischer, & Creef, 1991; Kiriazis\n& Slobodchikoff, 2006; Greene & Meagher, 1998; primates:\nMacedonia, 1990; Seyfarth, Cheney, & Marler, 1980; Struhsaker,\n1967; Zuberbu ̈hler, Cheney, & Seyfarth, 1999; Zuberbu ̈hler, 2001;\nKirchhof & Hammerschmidt, 2006). However, different predator\nclasses typically also impose differences in response urgency and\nthreat, and some species appear to respond mainly to these variables rather than predator class per se (e.g., lemurs: Fichtel &\nHammerschmidt, 2002; Macedonia, 1990; ground squirrels: Leger,\nAnne Marijke Schel and Klaus Zuberbu ̈hler, School of Psychology,\nUniversity of St. Andrews, UK, Centre Suisse de Recherches Scientifiques,\nIvory Coast, Budongo Conservation Field Station, Uganda; Sandra Tranquilli, Department of Anthropology, University College London, Centre\nSuisse de Recherches Scientifiques, Ivory Coast.\nThe Taı ̈ Monkey Project was funded by grants of the Leakey Foundation, the European Science Foundation (‘Origins of man, language, and\nlanguages’), and a EU FP6 Pathfinder grant (‘What it means to be human’).\nThe Budongo Conservation Field Station receives core funding from the\nRoyal Zoological Society of Scotland.

In some species, both predator type and urgency appear to interact to influence calling\nbehavior (e.g. surricates: Manser, 2001; Manser, Bell, & Fletcher,\n2001).\nIn primates, one common finding is that one alarm call type is\ngiven to a narrow range of events, typically dangerous raptors,\nwhile a second type is given to all sorts of other disturbances,\nincluding terrestrial predators, but sometimes also during intergroup encounters (e.g. white-faced capuchins: Digweed, Fedigan,\n& Rendall, 2005; Fichtel, Perry, & Gros-Louis, 2005; lemurs:\nFichtel & Kappeler, 2002; sifakas: Fichtel & van Schaik, 2006).\nAnother type of system is found in Chacma baboons and sooty\nmangabeys. Here, individuals produce only one general call type\nto predators, but there is much acoustic variation and some call\nvariants are also produced in nonpredation contexts. Experiments\nhave shown, however, that receivers are perfectly capable of\nassociating discrete events to such acoustically graded signals,\nsuggesting that discrete call types are not a prerequisite for encoding specific external events (Fischer, Hammerschmidt, Cheney, &\nSeyfarth, 2001; Range & Fischer, 2004).\nSome other primates follow a different strategy and convey\npredator information by assembling a small repertoire of call types\ninto more complex call sequences (cf. black-capped chickadees,\ne.g. Templeton et al., 2005). Campbell’s monkeys, for example,\nindicate low levels of threat, or signals aimed at competitors, by\nadding a pair of boom calls to subsequent loud call series, which\nare regularly given to predators (Zuberbu ̈hler, 2002). Another\nexample comes from putty-nosed monkeys, which produce two\nbasic types of alarm calls to predators. Unlike Diana or vervet\nmonkeys, both calls are regularly given to both leopards and\neagles, but the monkeys assemble the two calls into sequences\nspecific to the presence of eagles, sequences specific to the presence of leopards, and sequences that indicate group travel (Arnold,\nPohlner, & Zuberbu ̈hler, 2008; Arnold & Zuberbu ̈hler, 2006a,\n2006b, 2008). White handed gibbons, finally, use some of their\nvocal behavior, the songs, not only in pair bonding but also to\nindicate the presence of predators, such as clouded leopards or\ntigers. Experiments have shown that predator-induced songs consist of the same types of notes as normal songs, but they are\nassembled in subtly different ways. Differences in the arrangement\nof notes are meaningful to other gibbons, suggesting that this\nprimate is able to use simple combinatorial rules to convey\nwhether or not a caller is singing in response to the presence of a\npredator (Clarke, Reichard, & Zuberbu ̈hler, 2006). An emerging\npoint from these studies is that predation has selected for an\nastonishing vocal diversity in the primate order and other groups of\nanimals.\nIn this study, we analyze the alarm calling behavior of two\nspecies of a group of primates that have received little systematic\nattention in terms of alarm calling behavior, although they represent a major group of Old World monkeys, the colobines. The\navailable literature comes mostly from work on Guereza colobus\nmonkeys, a species of black-and-white colobus monkeys that has\nlong been known for its conspicuous calling behavior (Hill &\nBooth, 1957; Marler, 1972; Oates, Bocian, & Terranova, 2000;\nOates & Trocco, 1983). Adult males, sometimes joined by other\nindividuals, produce a vocal signal termed ‘roaring,’ which can be\nheard over long distances of one kilometer and more (Marler,\n1972). Individual roaring phrases (“phrases”) are rarely produced\nsingly, but given as part of longer sequences (Marler, 1972, 1977;\nOates, 1994; Oates et al., 2000; Oates & Trocco, 1983). These\nsignals are given in a variety of contexts, such as before dawn, in\nresponse to calls of other males and/or species, and in response to\nmajor disturbances, such as falling trees or the presence of predators (Marler, 1972). A second type of acoustic signal used in\npredatory situations, the ‘snort,’ is a low-amplitude, a-periodic\nsound, audible over short distances only. This signal is usually\ngiven in response to potential predators on the ground, such as\nleopards and (exceptionally) chimpanzees and humans (Marler,\n1972). Snorts can be given alone, but they usually precede roaring\nsequences. Although previous studies have recognized that both\nvocalizations play a role in predatory contexts, the evidence\nmainly comes from opportunistic observations of encounters between the colobus and potential predators. To date, no systematic\nstudies on the vocal alarm call system of black-and-white colobus\nmonkeys have been carried out.\nWe investigated the vocal alarm call behavior of King colobus\nmonkeys (Colobus polykomos) of Taı ̈ National Park, Ivory Coast,\nas well as that of Guereza colobus monkeys (Colobus guereza) of\nthe Budongo Forest Reserve, Uganda. We studied these species’\nresponses to two of their main predators, crowned eagles (Stephanoaetus coronatus) and leopards (Panthera pardus). These predators are common in the Taı ̈ Forest (densities: 1 leopard per 10\nkm2: Jenny, 1996; 1 crowned eagle per 2–3 km\n2 : Shultz, 2002) and\nthey have also been observed in the Kaniyo Pabidi area of the\nBudongo Forest. Chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) cause additional\nmortality at both sites, but the monkeys generally respond with\ncryptic behavior to their presence (Zuberbu ̈hler, Noe ̈, & Seyfarth,\n1997; Schel, 2009). We conducted playback experiments, in which\nwe played back typical vocalizations of leopards and crowned\neagles in the vicinity of different monkey groups in order to record\nand analyze the monkeys’ vocal responses.\nMethod\nStudy Sites and Subjects\nThe study area in Taı ̈ National Park consisted of approximately\n100 km2 of primary tropical evergreen seasonal lowland rain forest\n(N 5° 50\u0001, W 7° 21\u0001). In this area, King colobus groups occur at\ndensities of one or more groups per square kilometer (Zuberbu ̈hler\n& Jenny, 2002). Groups normally consist of one or two adult\nmales, approximately five adult females, and their subadult, juvenile, and infant offspring (Korstjens, 2001; Oates, 1994). In Taı ̈,\nplayback experiments were conducted between 1995 and 1998 and\nin 2004. The Kaniyo Pabidi study area of the Budongo Forest\nReserve (compartments K11, K12 and K13) consisted of approximately 11 km2 of primary tropical moist semideciduous rainforest\n(N 01° 55\u0001, E 31° 43\u0001). Guereza colobus groups in this area occur\nat relatively high densities of three to six groups per square\nkilometer (Plumptre & Reynolds, 1994; Plumptre, 2000). Guereza\ncolobus groups normally consist of one adult male, approximately\nfour adult females, and their subadult, juvenile and infant offspring\n(Marler, 1969; Oates, 1994). In Kaniyo Pabidi, playback experiments were conducted in 2006 and 2007.\n137BLACK-AND-WHITE COLOBUS MONKEY ALARM CALL SYSTEMThis document is copyrighted by the American Psychological Association or one of its allied publishers.\nThis article is intended solely for the personal use of the individual user and is not to be disseminated broadly.All rights, including for text and data mining, AI training, and similar technologies, are reserved.King colobus monkeys and Guereza colobus monkeys are regarded as two separate species belonging to a diverse group\nconsisting of five different black-and-white colobus species: C.\nsatanas, C. polykomos, C. vellerosus, C. guereza, and C. angolensis. C. vellerosus and C. polykomos are found in West Africa,\nwhereas the other three species are found in Central- and East\nAfrica (Oates, 1994). Acoustic analyses of roars of these five\nspecies by Oates and Trocco (1983) and Oates et al. (2000)\nsuggested that they are grouped in three clusters based on differences in temporal patterning, frequency and modulation of the\nroars. C. vellerosus and C. guereza share a recent common ancestor, and C. guereza appears to have the largest number of derived\nfeatures among the members of the black-and-white colobus\ngroup. C. polykomos and C. angolensis seem to be more primitive,\nbut have diverged rather little from each other, whereas C. satanas\nis a form that has not had a recent common ancestry with any other\nform, but is most closely related to the angolensis-polykomos pair.\nC. vellerosus is suggested to be an intermediate form between C.\npolykomos and C. guereza.\nGeneral Experimental Protocol\nWe used matching experimental protocols at both study sites.\nWe systematically searched for monkey groups throughout the\nstudy area. Groups were often found resting high up in a feeding\ntree. Once found, their exact geographical location was determined\nusing a GARMIN GPS 76 and a detailed map to ensure that the\ngroup had not been tested before and that experimental groups\nwere separated by a distance of at least one kilometer from each\nother (average home range King colobus monkeys at Taı ̈ 70 ha:\nKorstjens, 2001; average home range Guereza colobus monkeys at\nBudongo 10 –35 ha: Marler, 1969). We monitored the monkeys’\nvocal behavior for at least 15 min to make sure that they were\nunaware of our presence. Using a NAGRA DSM speakeramplifier, we then broadcast a playback stimulus consisting of 5\nmin silence followed by 15 s of predator vocalizations, either the\ngrowls of a leopard (N \u0002 6 exemplars, National Sound Archive,\nLondon) or the shrieks of a crowned eagle (N \u0002 3 exemplars,\nrecorded in the Taı ̈ study area). The playback equipment was\npositioned on or close to the ground (0-2 m) at a distance of circa\n20-40 m from the group, outside the visual range of the monkeys\nresiding in the trees.\nAlthough eagles are typically encountered in the lower or upper\ncanopy, they have been spotted on the forest floor, indicating that\nour experimental paradigm mimicked a possible natural situation.\nMoreover, other playback studies targeting different monkey species in the Taı ̈ National Park and Guereza colobus monkeys in the\nBudongo Forest Reserve had already shown that monkeys reliably\nresponded to playbacks of eagle shrieks. Crucially, in these experiments the monkeys responded identically to recorded eagle\nshrieks broadcast from a speaker positioned on the forest floor or\nwithin the canopy as well as to shrieks emitted by real crowned\neagles (e.g., Zuberbu ̈hler, 2001; Zuberbu ̈hler et al., 1997; Schel,\n2009).\nAll recordings began circa 5 min prior to playback and lasted at\nleast 15 min, regardless of whether or not the focal animals\nresponded vocally. In 2004, 2006, and 2007 vocalizations were\nrecorded with a SONY TCD D8 DAT recorder connected to a\nSENNHEISER K6/ME66 directional microphone. These roars\nwere transferred digitally from the DAT recorder onto a PC at a\nsampling rate of 48 kHz, 16 bits accuracy with Cool Edit, 2000\n(Syntrillium Software Cooperation). An additional N \u0002 7 eagle\nresponses, recorded between 1995 and 1999 in the Taı ̈ National\nPark, were added to the data set for the King colobus monkeys to\nincrease the sample size. These recordings were collected in the\nexact same way using the same experimental procedures and\nplayback equipment. They were made with a SONY TCM1000EV\nprofessional cassette recorder and then digitized using an EDIROL\nexternal sound card.\nTerminology\nThe basic structural features of Colobus roaring have been\ndescribed for Guereza colobus monkeys by Marler (1972); Oates\nand Trocco (1983) and Oates et al. (2000). Individual roaring\nphrases are the result of about a dozen glottal pulses, which appear\nin the spectrogram as compound units with an average duration of\nabout 700 – 800 ms. The acoustic energy in each phrase tends to\nappear as two discrete frequency bands on the spectrogram (M \u0003\nSD \u0002 590Hz \u0003 72 and M \u0003 SD \u0002 1280Hz \u0003 114; Figure 1A).\nIndividual roaring phrases are assembled into roaring sequences,\nwhich together form a bout. A bout is separated from another bout\nby a nonroaring period of at least one minute. Roaring sequences\nvary substantially in the number of roaring phrases they consist of,\nranging from one or two to 20 or more given in rapid succession\nwith intervals of around 200 ms between them. Roaring phrases\ncan vary in their acoustic structure, especially when comparing the\nfirst and last phrase in a sequence. The final phrase in a roaring\nsequence often is lower pitched, which generates a perceptually\nconspicuous marker to terminate the sequence (Marler, 1972;\nOates & Trocco, 1983). The first phrase in a roaring sequence can\nbe preceded by one or more ‘snorts’. Snorts consist of broadband\nacoustic energy with a sudden onset, ranging in frequency up to\nabout 4 kHz with the main frequency at around 1 kHz.\nKing Colobus roaring can be described with the same terminology, but in this species individual roaring phrases are the result of\nabout a dozen glottal pulses, which appear in the spectrogram as\ncompound units with an average duration of about 400 ms. Similar\nto Guereza colobus phrases, the acoustic energy in each King\ncolobus phrase appears on the spectrogram as two frequency\nbands, but the frequencies are higher, at around 650 Hz (M \u0003\nSD \u0002 650 \u0003 78), and 1400 Hz (M \u0003 SD \u0002 1390 \u0003 93),\nrespectively (Figure 1B; Oates & Trocco, 1983; Schel, 2009).\nAnalyses of Vocal Responses\nStructural measurements. From the vocal responses produced\nfor each predator type, we determined the following six structural\nparameters using spectrograms generated on RAVEN 1.2 (Cornell\nLaboratory of Ornithology, Ithaca, New York; Hanning window\nfunction; filter bandwidth: 124 Hz; frequency resolution: 86.1 Hz;\ngrid time resolution: 5.80 ms): (a) total duration of the vocal\nresponse(s), (b) total number of roaring sequences, (c) total number of roaring phrases, (d) mean number of roaring phrases per\nroaring sequence, (e) number of snorts, and (f) number of bouts\n(cf. Oates & Trocco, 1983).\nSome of the spectral parameters are likely to be correlated with\none another. However, in our analyses we were only interested in\n138 SCHEL, TRANQUILLI, AND ZUBERBU ̈ HLERThis document is copyrighted by the American Psychological Association or one of its allied publishers.\nThis article is intended solely for the personal use of the individual user and is not to be disseminated broadly.All rights, including for text and data mining, AI training, and similar technologies, are reserved.whether calling responses differed between contexts, not in the\nminimal number of spectral parameters that sufficiently accounted\nfor any such difference. Thus, we proceeded to report statistical\ncomparisons of all spectral measurements taken. Our overall analysis strategy was to investigate, for each structural and acoustic\nvariable, whether there were any differences as a function of\npredator type or the position of the phrase within a sequence.\nSpectral measurements. To compare the acoustic structure of\nindividual roaring phrases given to the two different predator playbacks we measured 7 different acoustic variables (see Figure 1). The\nfollowing temporal measures were determined using Raven 1.2\n(Cornell Laboratory of ornithology, Ithaca, New York; Hanning\nwindow function; filter bandwidth: 124 Hz; frequency resolution:\n86.1 Hz; grid time resolution: 5.80 ms): (a) phrase duration (ms):\ntime interval from the first to the last produced pulse; (b) number\nof pulses per roaring phrase; pulses were counted by playing back\nthe roar at 10% of the original speed; (c) fundamental frequency\n(Hz): number of pulses per second. The following spectral measures were extracted using PRAAT 4.3.12 (Boersma & Weenink,\n2005). Spectrogram settings: Hanning window shape; window\nlength \u0002 0.05 s, maximum frequency \u0002 3000 Hz, time step \u0002\n0.002 s, frequency step \u0002 20 Hz; Formant settings: burg algorithm; time step \u0002 0.05 s; maximum number of formants \u0002 3;\nmaximum formant frequency \u0002 2700 Hz; window length \u0002 0.025\ns., preemphasis from 50 Hz, (cf. Harris, Fitch, Goldstein, & Fashing, 2006): (d) harmonics-to-noise ratio (HNR, dB), defined as the\ndegree of acoustic periodicity; this represents the energy distribution of periodic signals versus noise (e) first and (f) second\nformants (Hz), representing the first and second peaks in the\nfrequency spectrum, which result from the resonant frequencies of\nthe calls, (g) peak frequency (Hz), defined as the frequency at\nwhich maximum acoustic energy occurs in the dominant frequency\nband of the phrase.\nAt both field sites, our pilot observations indicated that monkeys\npredominantly reacted with one bout of roaring to leopard playbacks, consisting of a large number of sequences that typically\ncontained only one or two roaring phrases each. To eagle playbacks, the response was the opposite. Although the monkeys\nmostly produced only one roaring bout, it generally contained only\ntwo sequences but they consisted of a large number of roaring\nFigure 1.

For systematic comparisons, we thus focused our\nspectral analyses on the first and last phrases of the first two\nroaring sequences, provided they contained at least two roaring\nphrases (i.e., four roaring phrases per response).\nInspection of King colobus’ recordings. In 2004, we tested 18\ndifferent groups of King colobus monkeys with playbacks of\nleopard growls and 24 different groups with playbacks of eagle\nshrieks. Two eagle trials were discounted as invalid because the\nmonkeys saw the equipment or the observer; one leopard trial was\ndiscounted as invalid due to equipment malfunctioning. The response rate to playback of eagle shrieks was relatively low. In only\n6 of 22 groups at least one individual responded with alarm\nvocalizations (response rate \u0002 27.3%). One of these trials had to\nbe discarded for further analyses because of high levels of background noise. To allow meaningful comparisons, we supplemented\nthis small sample with N \u0002 7 eagle recordings collected between\n1995 and 1999, yielding a final sample size of N \u0002 12 eagle\nresponses for the structural measurements. The response rate to\nplayback of leopard growls was higher. In 10 of 17 groups at least\none monkey responded with alarm vocalizations (response rate \u0002\n58.8%). Of these, one trial had to be discarded because of high\nlevels of background noise, yielding a final sample size of N \u0002 9\nleopard responses for the structural measurements.\nFrom these data, we were able to obtain reliable spectral data for\nthe first roaring sequences from N \u0002 8 leopard responses and\nanother N \u0002 8 eagle responses. For the second roaring sequence,\nwe had to discard one leopard response due to poor recording\nquality, yielding a final dataset of N \u0002 7 leopard responses. In 2 of\nthe 8 eagle trials, the animals did not produce a second roaring\nsequence. In one case, it was not possible to measure the last call\nof the second roaring sequence, which led to a final sample size of\nN \u0002 6 first calls and N \u0002 5 last calls for the second roaring sequence\nin the eagle context. Acoustic analyses of the first and last roars of the\nfirst two roaring sequences were made with PRAAT 4.3.12. Additional analyses were conducted with RAVEN 1.2.\nInspection of Guereza colobus’ recordings. In 2006, we tested\n27 different groups of Guereza colobus monkey groups with\nplaybacks of leopard growls and 31 different groups with playbacks of eagle shrieks. In 2007, we tested an additional 9 groups\nwith leopard growls and an additional 9 groups with eagle shrieks.\nOne eagle trial was discounted as invalid because the monkeys saw\nthe equipment or the observer, one eagle trial was discounted as\ninvalid due to equipment malfunctioning, and three leopard trials\nwere discounted as invalid because the monkeys saw the equipment or the observer. Total numbers of valid playback experiments\nused for overall analyses thus was N \u0002 33 for leopard growls and\nN \u0002 38 for eagle shrieks.\nLike in Taı ̈, the response rate to eagle shrieks was relatively low.\nIn only 8 of 38 groups at least one individual responded with alarm\nvocalizations (response rate \u0002 21.1%). In contrast to Taı ̈, however,\nthe response rate to leopards was relatively low as well. In only 12\nof 33 groups at least one monkey responded with alarm vocalizations (response rate \u0002 36.4%). In three of these 12 responses to\nleopard growls, high levels of background noise made it impossible to code the complete vocal reaction, and these recordings had\nto be excluded from acoustic analyses, generating a final sample\nsize of N \u0002 9 leopard and N \u0002 8 eagle responses for the structural\nmeasurements.\nFor the spectral measurements, one additional leopard trial had\nto be discarded because of poor recording quality. We were therefore able to obtain reliable spectral data for the analyses of the first\nroaring sequences from N \u0002 8 leopard responses and another N \u0002\n8 eagle responses. In one leopard response, the caller did not\nproduce a second roaring sequence containing a first and last\nphrase; this individual just continued roaring with one phrase\nroaring sequences after the initial two phrase roaring sequence.\nThis led to a final sample size of N \u0002 7 leopard responses and N \u0002\n8 eagle responses for analyses of the second roaring sequences.\nAcoustic analyses of the first and last roars of the first two roaring\nsequences were made with PRAAT 4.3.12. Additional analyses\nwere conducted with RAVEN 1.2.\nStatistical Analyses\nA matched-pair design (every group contributing a leopard and\nan eagle response to the final dataset) would have been an obvious\nchoice for the intended comparisons. However, this approach is\nusually not practical for fieldwork, especially because the exact\nranging behavior of the different unhabituated groups is not\nknown. Moreover, because of the low response rate of these\nmonkeys to eagles and leopards, our experimental protocol was to\ntest each group only once.\nWe checked for normal distribution both within and between\ngroup responses using the SPSS Software Package 12.0. Conditions for parametric analyses were not met and we thus proceeded\nwith nonparametric analyses. Critical p values were adjusted to\n\u00040.025 using a Bonferroni correction if the same dataset was used\nfor two different comparisons. All reported p values are exact p\nvalues and all testing was two-tailed (Brace, Kemp, & Snelgar,\n2000; Hawkins, 2005). 97.5% confidence intervals for means were\ncalculated using the descriptive statistics option in SPSS. Nonparametric effect sizes (r, Field, 2005) were estimated by dividing the\nz-score by the square root of the total number of observations.\nValues of r can lie between 0 (no effect) and 1 (perfect effect),\nwith the widely used accepted standards of r \u0002 .10 (small effect),\nr \u0002 .30 (medium effect) and r \u0002 .50 (large effect).\nResults\nGeneral Response Characteristics in Taı ̈\nand Kaniyo Pabidi\nIf more than one individual called in response to the predator\nplaybacks, we used the vocal response of the individual that\ncalled first for subsequent analyses; other calling individuals\nwere not used in any analyses. In all trials used for temporal and\nstructural analyses, the calling individuals could be clearly\ndistinguished. As already mentioned, the response rates at both\nsites were generally low, with slight but nonsignificant differences between the predator types (Taı ̈: leopards: 59%, eagles:\n27%, p \u0002 .06; Kaniyo Pabidi: leopards 36%, eagles: 21%, p \u0002\n.19, Fisher’s exact test, two-tailed). If calling occurred in response to a predator playback, callers often combined their\nvocal response with conspicuous visual display behavior, jumping vigorously from branch to branch and thereby approaching\nthe site to inspect the source (Taı ̈: leopard: 9 of 10 trials, eagle:\n4 of 6 trials; Kaniyo Pabidi: leopard: 7 of 12 trials; eagle: 6 of\n140 SCHEL, TRANQUILLI, AND ZUBERBU ̈ HLERThis document is copyrighted by the American Psychological Association or one of its allied publishers.\nThis article is intended solely for the personal use of the individual user and is not to be disseminated broadly.All rights, including for text and data mining, AI training, and similar technologies, are reserved.8 trials). In Taı ̈, other group members joined the approaching\ncaller in 4 of 9 leopard trials, but never in response to eagle\ntrials. In Kaniyo Pabidi, the approaching caller was joined in 4\nof 7 leopard trials and 5 of 6 eagle trials. In all remaining cases,\none or several individuals called, but no one approached.\nAcoustic Structure of Individual Roaring Phrases\nFor the King colobus monkeys, comparisons of leopard responses revealed significant differences between the first and final\nroaring phrases for both the first and second sequence. Comparisons of eagle responses revealed the same pattern, although differences did not reach significant levels (Tables 1 & 2). For the\nGuereza colobus monkeys, the same significant differences were\nfound between the first and final roaring phrases in both the first\nand second sequence, for both leopard and eagle responses (Tables\n1 & 2).\nCrucially, when comparing roaring phrases between the two\npredator types we found no significant differences in King\ncolobus in any of the spectral parameters. The same was the\ncase for Guereza colobus with the exception of the harmonicsto-noise ratios (HNR), which were higher in response to leopards than eagles. Measurements of all other acoustic variables\ndid not yield any predator-specific acoustic differences (Table 1\n& 2). These results suggest that, although both species produced\ntwo types of roaring phrases, these were not given in predatorspecific ways, but simply indicated the phrases locations within\nthe sequence.\nComposition of Roaring Sequences\nIn contrast to the acoustic features, we found clear differences in\nthe structural composition of the roaring sequences produced in\nresponse to eagles and leopards. Most importantly the number of\nroaring phrases per sequence was significantly smaller in response\nto leopards than eagles (Taı ̈: ML \u0002 3.8 \u0003 2.1 (\u0003SD); ME \u0002\n15.8 \u0003 2.6 (\u0003SD); U \u0002 8, exact p \u0002 .000, r \u0002 .71; Kaniyo Pabidi:\nM L \u0002 1.4 \u0003 1.1; M E \u0002 7.1 \u0003 1.2; U \u0002 1, exact p \u0002 .000, r \u0002 .82;\nU test, two-tailed). Second, roaring sequences to leopards, but not\neagles, were typically preceded by “snorts” (Taı ̈: 9 of 9 leopard\ntrials, 4 of 12 eagle trials; p \u0002 .005; Kaniyo Pabidi: 9 of 9 leopard\ntrials; 4 of 8 eagle trials, p \u0002 .029; Fisher’s exact test, two-tailed).\nBoth species produced a higher number of snorts in response to\nleopard growls than in response to eagle shrieks (Taı ̈: M L \u0002\n24.4 \u0003 20.6; ME \u0002 4.4 \u0003 9.0; U \u0002 12, exact p \u0002 .002, r \u0002 .67;\nKaniyo Pabidi: ML \u0002 43.9 \u0003 58.3; ME \u0002 3.8 \u0003 4.1; U \u0002 10.5,\nexact p \u0002 .012, r \u0002 .60; U test, two-tailed). In both species, snorts\nwere also produced to chimpanzees and humans, although the\ndefault reaction to these predators was to remain cryptic (Schel,\n2009). Furthermore, King colobus males, but not Guereza colobus\nmales, produced longer roars to leopards than to eagles, both in\nterms of the total duration of calling (Taı ̈: ML \u0002 312.3 \u0003 162.9 s;\nME \u0002 77.8 \u0003 68.9 s; U \u0002 12.5, exact p \u0002 .003, r \u0002 .64; Kaniyo\nPabidi: ML \u0002 248.7 \u0003 284.7s; ME \u0002 145.8 \u0003 130.1s; U \u0002 30,\nexact p \u0002 .587, r \u0002 .14; U test, two-tailed) and the total number\nof roaring phrases produced (Taı ̈: M L \u0002 191 \u0003 97.2; ME \u0002 79.2 \u0003\n68.5; U \u0002 19; exact p \u0002 .013, r \u0002 .54; Kaniyo Pabidi: ML \u0002\n91.0 \u0003 138.1; ME \u0002 48.5 \u0003 50.6; U \u0002 35, exact p \u0002 .945, r \u0002\n.02; U test, two-tailed). Finally, King colobus males, but not\nGuereza colobus males, produced leopard responses with a higher\ntotal number of roaring sequences than those to eagles (Taı ̈: M L \u0002\n64.4 \u0003 36.4; ME \u0002 11.6 \u0003 20.3; U \u0002 8, exact p \u0002 .001, r \u0002 .72;\nKaniyo Pabidi: ML \u0002 53.7 \u0003 82.6; ME \u0002 13.1 \u0003 23.3; U \u0002 28,\nexact p \u0002 .465, r \u0002 .19; U test, two-tailed). As mentioned before,\nthe number of bouts produced to leopards and eagles did not differ\nsignificantly at both sites (Taı ̈: ML \u0002 2 \u0003 1.41, ME \u0002 1.7 \u0003 0.98;\nU \u0002 49, exact p \u0002 .728, r \u0002 .09; Kaniyo Pabidi: ML \u0002 1 \u0003 0,\nME \u0002 1.1 \u0003 0.13; U \u0002 31.5, exact p \u0002 .471; r \u0002 .26; U test;\ntwo-tailed: Figures 2 & 3).\nDiscussion\nIn contrast to other primate species, particularly Diana monkeys,\nwe found no evidence that individual calls (“roaring phrases”) of\nWest African King colobus monkeys varied in their acoustic\nstructure depending on the predator type encountered. Instead, our\nanalyses revealed consistent differences in the structural organization at the level of call sequences: responses to leopards consisted\nof a small number of roaring phrases per sequence compared to\neagle responses. These leopard responses lasted longer, were composed of more sequences, and consisted of a larger total number of\nphrases than those to eagles. All statistical comparisons were\nhighly significant, with little or no overlap, particularly during the\nfirst few sequences. In the closely related Guereza colobus monkeys of East Africa, there were a number of striking similarities,\nespecially with regards to the difference in the number of roaring\nphrases per sequence as a function of predator context. Other\nstructural differences were species-specific, such as total duration\nof roaring, total number of roaring phrases, and total number of\nroaring sequences.\nAnother shared feature of both King colobus and Guereza\ncolobus was the frequent use of snorts accompanying leopard\nreactions, but rarely eagle reactions. Snorts were sometimes also\ngiven to humans and chimpanzees. Since all playback experiments\nwere conducted from the ground, snorts did not simply indicate\ndanger from the ground, but seemed to be used in more specific\ncontexts, which generally included leopards, humans, and chimpanzees, but not eagles.\nFinally, in both King and Guereza colobus, the final roaring\nphrase produced in a sequence was acoustically different from\nthe preceding ones, demonstrating subtle but consistent acoustic\nchanges throughout a roaring sequence. For the King colobus,\neffects were highly significant in the leopard context, and the\nsame effect was found in the eagle context. In the Guereza\ncolobus, the differences were also highly significant for both\npredator types, in line with earlier reports (Marler, 1972).\nPerceptually, the acoustically distinct last phrases reliably indicate the end of a roaring sequence, but whether this feature\npossesses signal value, or whether it is a mere by-product\ncaused by relaxation of the animal’s musculature, is a matter of\nfurther research.\nOne minor effect in the acoustic structure of individual\nroaring phrases concerned the difference in the HNR of Guereza\nroars. This acoustic variable can be influenced by random\nfactors such as an inadequate closure of the vocal folds, allowing excessive airflow through the glottis, which can cause\nturbulence during phonation, a-periodic vocal fold vibration,\nand pitch perturbations (Ferrand, 2002; Shama, Krishna, &\n141BLACK-AND-WHITE COLOBUS MONKEY ALARM CALL SYSTEMThis document is copyrighted by the American Psychological Association or one of its allied publishers.\nThis article is intended solely for the personal use of the individual user and is not to be disseminated broadly.All rights, including for text and data mining, AI training, and similar technologies, are reserved.Table 1\nMeasurements of Acoustic Variables of the First and Last Phrases Given in the First and Second Roaring Sequences (RS) Between Contexts for King Colobus Monkeys and\nGuereza Colobus Monkeys\nKing colobus\nWithin leopard (L) Within eagle (E)\nFirst phrase Last phrase First phrase Last phrase\nAcoustic variable Mdn M CI (97.5%) Mdn M CI (97.5%) Mdn M CI (97.5%) Mdn M CI (97.5%)\n1st RS\nPhrase duration (ms) 432 452 307–596 244 261 166–355 441 409 265–554 268 269 152–386\nHarmonics-noise ratio (dB) 6.48 7.42 3.27–11.56 7.2 8.4 4–13 4.74 4.65 1.12–8.17 4.01 5.18 \u00050.06–10.42\nFirst formant (Hz) 664 664 596–731 675 696 575–817 711 698 637–759 633 658 588–727\nSecond formant (Hz) 1399 1435 1344–1526 1347 1456 1180–1731 1433 1433 1352–1514 1358 1394 1298–1490\nPeak frequency (Hz) 623 616 566–666 554 520 386–653 648 643 563–723 610 630 529–731\nNumber of pulses 12 14 9–19 6 7 4–9 15 13 8–18 9 9 5–12\nFundamental freq (Hz) 32 31 26–36 26 25 20–30 34 32 26–39 33 31 23–39\n2nd RS\nPhrase duration (ms) 521 555 454–657 239 232 144–320 404 499 101–897 269 270 217–322\nHarmonics-noise ratio (dB) 10.04 9.7 6–14 8.09 8.84 3.25–14.42 2.54 4.97 \u00052.3–\n12.25\n5.86 6.88 \u00050.43–14.20\nFirst formant (Hz) 666 669 607–730 672 649 549–749 697 699 621–777 653 666 558–775\nSecond formant (Hz) 1467 1453 1298–1607 1365 1420 1283–1558 1425 1466 1262–1671 1354 1376 1247–1505\nPeak frequency (Hz) 623 642 600–685 568 560 481–639 668 660 552–784 623 610 471–750\nNumber of pulses 16 17 13–20 8 7 4–11 13 14 5–24 8 8 6–10\nFundamental freq (Hz) 31 30 28–32 33 32 23–41 29 29 24–34 33 31 23–40\nWithin leopard (L) Within eagle (E)\nGuereza colobus First phrase Last phrase First phrase Last phrase\nAcoustic variable Mdn M CI (97.5%) Mdn M CI (97.5%) Mdn M CI (97.5%) Mdn M CI (97.5%)\n1st RS\nPhrase duration (ms) 1110 1079 741–1417 371 292 129–455 755 845 423–1267 324 354 281–427\nHarmonics-noise ratio (dB) 10.14 9.36 7–12 7.2 6.76 4–10 4.64 4.98 3–7 2.94 3.51 2–5\nFirst formant (Hz) 552 559 508–609 586 635 441–830 587 598 547–649 540 619 435–803\nSecond formant (Hz) 1248 1280 1180–1379 1386 1416 1104–1727 1229 1251 1147–1354 1161 1282 996–1569\nPeak frequency (Hz) 527 523 493–554 490 477 397–558 538 546 501–591 438 502 324–680\nNumber of pulses 18 19 13–24 7 5 2–8 15 16 9–23 6 7 6–8\nFundamental freq (Hz) 18 17 15–19 18 18 15–20 20 19 18–21 20 20 18–21\n2nd RS\nPhrase duration (ms) 968 1068 719–1418 295 335 112–559 708 914 458–1371 359 353 217–488\nHarmonics-noise ratio (dB) 9.26 9.01 6–12 7.78 7.61 6–9 4.27 4.24 2–6 4.47 4.19 2–6\nFirst formant (Hz) 572 603 471–734 520 607 371–843 589 602 543–661 595 601 544–659\nSecond formant (Hz) 1257 1299 1162–1437 1216 1320 986–1655 1214 1290 1144–1436 1225 1318 1104–1532\nPeak frequency (Hz) 544 623 346–900 479 590 179–1002 568 628 405–852 468 479 414–543\nNumber of pulses 18 18 13–24 5 6 2–10 14 16 10–23 7 7 4–9\nFundamental freq (Hz) 18 17 16–19 17 18 15–20 18 18 17–20 18 19 16–21\nNote.

For the King colobus, the differences in HNR\nproduced between predator types were in the same direction.\nMost likely, this is a side effect of the differently structured\nroaring sequences produced to the two predator types. The long\nroaring sequences produced to eagles may require the monkeys\nto take in more air before vocalizing compared to when producing the shorter leopard sequences, perhaps causing subtle\ndifferences in vocal fold behavior and turbulence when producing individual phrases. It is highly unlikely, however, that this\nfeatures alone is conspicuous enough to carry any predator\ninformation, especially over longer distances.\nInstead, the most salient and consistent differences of King\nand Guereza colobus predator-specific alarm calling were not\nfound in the acoustic characteristics of individual roaring\nphrases, but in the number of roaring phrases per sequence, and\nin the production of snorts accompanying these sequences.\nBased on the taxonomic studies by Oates and Trocco (1983) and\nOates et al. (2000), we assumed that these features are also\nshared with C. vellerosus, and perhaps also by C. angolensis\nand C. satanas, but further studies are needed to confirm this.\nConspecific Warning\nThe fact that both monkey species responded with different\nvocal behavior to the two predator types opens the possibility\nthat black-and-white colobus monkeys provide nearby listeners\nwith information about the type of predator or threat spotted by\nthe caller, a conspecific warning function. In order to determine\nwhether nearby receivers are able to attend to the structural\ndifferences, playback experiments must be carried out eventually in which the different alarm vocalizations are played back\nto nearby conspecifics. In Guereza colobus monkeys, we have\ncarried out such work and found that individuals responded\nwith identical vocal and behavioral reactions to playbacks of\n(a) Number of phrases per RS\nLeopar d Eagl e\nPredator playback stimulus\n0.00\n10.00\n20.00\n30.00\nMean number of roars per roaring sequence\n(b) Number of snorts\nelgaEdrapoeL\nPredator playback stimulus\n0.00\n10.00\n20.00\n30.00\n40.00\n50.00\n60.00\n70.00\nNumber of snorts\n(c) Total roaring duration\nLeopard Eagle\nPredator playback stimulus\n0.00\n200000.0\n400000.0\n600000.0\n800000.0\n1000000.0\nTotal roaring duration (ms)\n(d) Number of roaring phrases\nLeopard Eagle\nPredator playback stimulus\n0.00\n100.0\n200.0\n300.0\nTotal number of roars\ne) Number of Roaring Sequences\nLeopar d Eagle\n0.00\n20.00\n40.00\n60.00\n80.00\n100.0\n0\n120.0\n0\nTotal number of roaring sequences\nPredator playback stimulus\n(f) Number of bouts\n129N =\nPredator Play back Stimulus\nEagleLeopard\nNumber of bouts\n6\n5\n4\n3\n2\n1\n0\n11\nA B\n(a) Number of phrases per RS\n89N =\nPredator playback stimulus\nEagleLeopard\nMean nr Phrases per Roaring Sequence 16\n14\n12\n10\n8\n6\n4\n2\n0\n-2\n10\n(b) Number of snorts\n89N =\nPredator play back stimulus\nEagleLeopard\nNumber of snorts\n300\n200\n100\n0\n-100\n5\n(c) Total roaring duration\n89N =\nPredator playback stimulus\nEagleLeopard\nTotal Roaring Duration (s)\n1000\n800\n600\n400\n200\n0\n-200\n(d) Number of roaring phrases\n89N =\nPredator Playback stimulus\nEagleLeopard\nTotal nr. roaring phrases\n500\n400\n300\n200\n100\n0\n-100\n21\n5\n(e) Number of Roaring Sequences\n89N =\nPredator Play back Stimulus\nEagleLeopard\nTotal nr Roaring Sequences\n300\n200\n100\n0\n-100\n21\n5\n(f) Number of bouts\n89N =\nPredator Playback Stimulus\nEagleLeopard\nNumber of Bouts\n2,2\n2,0\n1,8\n1,6\n1,4\n1,2\n1,0\n,8\n16\nFigure 3.

For example, it has been shown that predator-specific\nalarm calls can also benefit the signaler directly (Cheney & Seyfarth, 1981). Predators often differ with regard to sensory and\npsychological specializations, which is likely to act as a direct\nselection factor in the evolution of form and patterning of alarm\nsignals (e.g., Owings & Morton, 1997; Rundus, Owings, Joshi,\nChinn, & Giannini, 2007).\nIn sum, predator-specific vocal behavior allows receivers to\nmake inferences about predator type based on signaling alone,\nalthough this may not be the evolved function of predator specific\nsignaling. In line with this, eavesdropping is increasingly recognized as an important mechanism in animal communication\n(McGregor & Dabelsteen, 1996; Peake, Matessi, McGregor, &\nDabelsteen, 2005) and it is entirely conceivable that callers are\ntargeting the predator while conspecifics are merely eavesdropping, suggesting that there is not necessarily symmetry in the\nmechanisms and functions of signaler and receiver behavior\n(Owings, 1994).\nPredator Deterrence\nAnother finding of this study was that the overall response\nrates to the two predator types were relatively low, but not\nsignificantly different between predator types (Taı ̈: leopards:\n59%, eagles: 27%; Kaniyo Pabidi: leopards: 36%, eagles: 21%).\nColobus monkeys generally lead a relatively cryptic life and\nmay thus often be reluctant to engage in conspicuous calling\nbehavior, much in contrast to other primates such as, for example, Diana monkeys (Zuberbu ̈ hler et al., 1997). In general,\nconspicuous calling may be a more effective strategy to leopards than to eagles. Forest leopards are surprise hunters that\nlose much of their dangerousness once detected. A radiotracking study has shown that leopards move on and leave the\narea once detected by a group of alarm calling monkeys, suggesting that conspicuous alarm calling has direct benefits for\nthe caller (Zuberbu ̈ hler et al., 1999). Crowned eagles might be\nless affected by such behavior. However, they have been observed to flee in response to physical attacks by large monkeys,\nan antipredator behavior regularly employed by adult male\nKing and Guereza colobus (Schel, 2009). Calling to eagles may\nthus become more important once the eagle is located, for\nexample to signal aggressive intent, a situation that we were\nunable to model with the playback experiments.\nOne way of investigating the relation between alarm call\nresponse rates and predator localization is to present visual\npredator models to monkey groups. Unfortunately, the peculiar\nactivity pattern of black-and-white colobus monkeys (60% of\ntheir activity budget is spent resting, 20% feeding and only 5%\ntraveling; Oates, 1977, 1994) makes it difficult to conduct\nsystematic experiments with nonmoving models, such as\nperched eagle models, as done with other species (Arnold et al.,\n2008). We did, however, conduct experiments in which we\npresented the Guereza colobus of Kaniyo Pabidi with a moving\nleopard model (Schel, 2009). Interestingly, the monkeys responded with alarm calls in a much higher proportion of cases\nthan after hearing leopard growls. Direct visual encounters with\na predator may thus be an important precondition for alarm\ncalling in this species. Observations of natural encounters with\ncrowned eagles very much confirmed this pattern: crowned\neagles could often be heard vocalizing at their nests or in social\ndisplays, which rarely triggered a vocal response. However, a\nsilent eagle flying through the canopy toward a monkeys group\ncould trigger fierce and aggressive roaring. The monkeys usually combined roaring with pursuing the eagle through the\ncanopy and chasing it away, suggesting that the calls are an\nintegral part of aggressive predator deterrence behavior.\nClassification of the Black-and-White Colobus\nAlarm Call System\n(a) Predator labeling. For vervet monkeys and some other\nprimates, it has been argued that individuals use their alarm\ncalls to refer to or “label” specific external events, such as the\npresence of a leopard. Although both colobus monkey species\nproduced at least two acoustically distinguishable call types\n(two types of phrase variants, snorts), none of them was given\nexclusively to one predator class. Instead, the monkeys assembled roaring phrases and snorts into longer sequences that\ndiffered between predator contexts. Roaring sequences always\nconsisted of variable numbers of phrases, followed by a lowerpitched phrase that marked the end of the sequence. These\nsequences could be introduced by some snorts. This typically,\nbut not exclusively, occurred if the caller had spotted a terrestrial\npredator. Overall, the monkeys produce highly patterned and reliable\npredator-specific alarm call sequences, and these sequences appear to\nbe meaningful to receivers (Schel, 2009).\n(b) Urgency response. Results might justifiably be interpreted as mediated by basic differences in response urgency,\nrather than as the product of cognitively more complex mental\nrepresentations of different predator types. Predator class may\nonly be relevant insofar as they indicate different levels of\nthreat. According to this hypothesis, a predator’s biological\nclass is only one of several variables that feed into the caller’s\ncomputations about a predator’s degree of threat. For example,\nit could be argued that eagles are perceived as inherently more\nthreatening than leopards (which probably do not pose much of\na risk as long as the monkeys remain within the main canopy).\nOne prediction from this hypothesis is that two different predator classes should elicit the same response if the perceived\nthreat is equal (e.g., an eagle detected at a safe distance or a\nleopard detected at close range). In the present study, predator\ndistance varied between trials, but no clear distance-related\npatterns emerged. There was some indication that the response\nrate and number of snorts produced to leopards was dependent\non the distance and/or modality of the stimulus. The leopard\nmodels were presented right under the groups in Kaniyo Pabidi,\nand evoked many more snorts than playback of the leopard\ngrowls from a distance of around 25 m (Schel, 2009).\nAll predator stimuli were played from the ground, making it\ndifficult to argue that response differences were driven by differences in the direction of threat. Moreover, in one pilot study we\nconducted five eagle playback experiments in which the speaker\nwas positioned at a height of 15 m within the main tree canopy\n(Schel, 2009), but this did not yield any vocal responses from the\n146 SCHEL, TRANQUILLI, AND ZUBERBU ̈ HLERThis document is copyrighted by the American Psychological Association or one of its allied publishers.\nThis article is intended solely for the personal use of the individual user and is not to be disseminated broadly.All rights, including for text and data mining, AI training, and similar technologies, are reserved.monkeys either, contradicting the notion that eagles within the\ncanopy are perceived as more dangerous.\nWe also conducted experiments with chimpanzee vocalizations and chimpanzee models (Schel, 2009) to which the monkeys mainly responded cryptically. If calls were produced (N \u0002\n4 to chimpanzee pant hoots and N \u0002 8 to chimpanzee models),\ncalling responses were generally identical to responses to leopard growls and leopard models, although the total duration of\ncalling was higher in response to leopard-related stimuli. Interestingly, we observed two instances during which an injured\nadult male Guereza colobus monkey was surrounded by hunting\nchimpanzees. In both cases, the males produced two-phrase\nroaring sequences, typical of encounters with leopards and\nchimpanzees. The prediction that two different predator classes\ncan elicit the same response if their perceived threat is equal (in\nthis case, e.g., an eagle pursuing a monkey through the canopy,\nbut also a group of hunting chimpanzees closing in and pursuing a monkey through the canopy) is clearly not supported by\nTable 3\nStudies That Investigated the Alarm Call System of Different Mammal Species\nSpecies\nAlarm Call System (PRIMATES)\nPredator labeling Urgency response Mixed Graded Call sequences\nLemuroids\nPropithecus verreauxi Fichtel & Kappeler,\n2002\nP. v. coquereli Fichtel & v.\nSchaik, 2006\nLemur catta Macedonia, 1990\nEulemur f. rufus Fichtel & Hammerschmidt,\n2002\nFichtel & Kappeler,\n2002\nVarecia variegata Macedonia, 1990\nCallitrichids\nSaguinus fuscicollis Kirchhof & Hammerschmidt,\n2006\nSaguinus mystax\nCebids\nCebus capucinus Fichtel et al., 2005,\nDigweed et al.,\n2005\nCercopithecines\nCercocebus atys Range & Fischer\n2005\nC. aethiops Struhsaker, 1967\nSeyfarth et al., 1980\nC. campbelli Zuberbu ̈hler, 2001\nC. diana Zuberbu ̈hler et al., 1999 Zuberbu ̈hler, 2002\nC. nictitans martini Arnold & Zuberbu ̈hler\n2006, 2008\nPapio c. ursinus Fischer et al.\n2001\nHylobatids\nHylobates lar Clarke et al. 2006\nSpecies\nAlarm Call System (NON-PRIMATES)\nFunctionally referential Urgency response Mixed Graded Call sequences\nSciurids\nCynomys guunisoni Slobodchikoff et al., 1991\nKiriazis &\nSlobodchikoff, 2006\nMarmota spp. Blumstein & Armitage,\n1997; Blumstein,\n1999\nSpermophilus beecheyi Owings & Virginia,\n1978\nSpermophilus beldingi Leger et al., 1980\nTamiasciuris hudsonicus Greene & Meagher, 1998\nMurids\nParotomys brantsii Le Roux et al., 2001 Le Roux et al., 2001\nHerpestids\nSuricatta suricatta Manser, 2001\nManser et al., 2001\n147BLACK-AND-WHITE COLOBUS MONKEY ALARM CALL SYSTEMThis document is copyrighted by the American Psychological Association or one of its allied publishers.\nThis article is intended solely for the personal use of the individual user and is not to be disseminated broadly.All rights, including for text and data mining, AI training, and similar technologies, are reserved.these anecdotes. In other studies, differences in threat or urgency also only had minor effects on monkeys’ alarm calling\nbehavior and usually did not cause alterations of alarm call\ntypes (Seyfarth et al., 1980; Zuberbu ̈ hler, 2000, but see Fichtel\n& Hammerschmidt, 2002). It therefore seems justified to conclude that differences in threat only had minor effects on calling\nbehavior of black-and-white colobus monkeys, but more systematic future studies might tell a different story.\n(c) Imminent behavior. Another theoretical position is that\ndifferent types of alarm calling behavior do not refer to different classes of predators, but are indicative of the behavioral\nresponse the caller is about to perform (, e.g., approach the\npredator, attack the predator, move away from the predator;\nSmith, 1977, 1996). Predator type and appropriate antipredator\nbehavior are strongly associated, but callers may only be signaling their own forthcoming behavior in these instances, regardless of predator type. It is interesting that the main behavioral responses observed in conjunction with the different vocal\nresponses were rather similar in this study. In 90% of vocal\nresponses to leopards and in 67% of vocal responses to eagles,\nKing colobus males rushed toward the location from where the\nstimulus was broadcast. This happened in 58% of leopard trials\nand 75% of eagle trials in Guereza colobus males. Although the\nbehaviors were identical (approaching the speaker), this may\nhave happened for different reasons. King colobus and Guereza\ncolobus have been observed to chase eagles away by running\ntoward them through the dense canopy and roaring fiercely. To\nleopards, callers also approach but usually keep a safe distance\nfrom the ground, probably to monitor the predator and inform it\nthat it has been detected.\n(d) Call combinations. Finally, the fact that black-and-white\ncolobus monkeys organize their signals into sequences using\none or more different vocal signals is not a novel finding (e.g.,\nArnold & Zuberbu ̈ hler, 2006a, 2006b; Marler, 1972; Robinson,\n1984; Zuberbu ̈ hler, 2002), but very few systematic studies have\nbeen conducted to examine the communicative significance or\nmeaning of such sequencing behavior (Arnold & Zuberbu ̈ hler,\n2006a, 2006b, 2008; Clarke et al., 2006; Zuberbu ̈ hler, 2002). In\nline with these recent studies, black-and-white colobus monkeys’ roaring phrases appear to serve as units that obtain their\nmeaning only once they are combined into higher-order sequences, a feature already discussed by Marler (1977). The\nnumber of roaring phrases given before the final low phrase in\neach sequence might encode predator type.\nIn sum, we have shown in this study that these monkeys\ncombine different call types in context-specific vocal responses,\nrelying primarily on perceptual salience of “few” versus\n“many” in the number of roaring phrases produced before the\nlast low-pitched phrase of a sequence. Whether these differences in call sequencing serve to encode predator type, type of\nthreat, urgency of the situation or the caller’s imminent behavior is a largely unresolved matter that requires further empirical\nwork. As so often with field studies, it was not possible to\naccess any of the caller’s mental representations, motivations or\ndifferences in arousal (see Fichtel, Hammerschmidt, & Ju ̈ rgens,\n2001 for captive squirrel monkeys). Instead, we drew inferences\nabout these possible underlying psychological variables from\nthe observed behavioral patterns in relation to existing models\nof alarm calling behavior (see Table 3). In our data, monkeys\nshowed robust responses to different predator types, regardless\nof differences in threat, and the major way of encoding predator\nclass was by varying the number of phrases to generate roaring\nsequences and by combining these with or without snorts.\nReferences\nArnold, K., Pohlner, Y., & Zuberbuhler, K.

Courter and Gary Ritchison\nDepartment of Biological Sciences, Eastern Kentucky University, Moore 235, 521 Lancaster Ave.,\nRichmond, KY 40475, USA\nMany birds utter alarm calls when they encounter predators, and previous work has revealed that variation in the characteristics\nof the alarm, or ‘‘chick-a-dee,’’ calls of black-capped (Poecile atricapilla) and Carolina (P. carolinensis) chickadees conveys information about predator size and threat. Little is known, however, about possible information conveyed by the similar ‘‘chick-a-dee’’\nalarm call of tufted titmice (Baeolophus bicolor). During the winters of 2008 and 2009, free-ranging flocks (N ¼ 8) of tufted titmice\nwere presented with models of several species of raptors that varied in size, and titmice responses were monitored. Smaller,\nhigher threat predators (e.g., eastern screech-owl, Megascops asio) elicited longer mobbing bouts and alarm calls with more notes\n(D-notes) than larger lower threat predators (e.g., red-tailed hawk, Buteo jamaicensis). During playback experiments, titmice took\nlonger to return to feeding after playbacks of alarm calls given in response to a small owl than to playbacks given in response to\na large hawk or a robin (control). Like chickadees, titmice appear to utter alarm calls that convey information about predator size\nand threat. Titmice, however, appear to cue in on the total number of D-notes given per unit time instead of the number of\nD-notes per alarm call. The broadband alarm calls of titmice, containing D-notes uttered in an unpredictable manner that may\nmake it difficult for predators to determine the number of titmice calling, may be particularly well suited for deterring predators.\nKey words: alarm calls, call characteristics, mobbing, predation risk, predator size. [Behav Ecol 21:936–942 (2010)]\nM any animals utter alarm calls when they encounter predators (Arnold and Zuberbuhler 2006; Frederiksen and\nSlobodchikoff 2007; Botham et al. 2008), and these calls\nmay alert group members and kin of danger, call for assistance, or inform predators that they have been spotted and\nare no longer a threat (Hill 1986; Langham et al. 2006). For\nsome species, alarm calls may provide specific information\nabout the type of predator present (functionally referential;\nPereira and Macedonia 1991; Kirchhof and Hammerschmidt\n2006), the level of threat a predator poses (urgency based;\nWelbergen and Davies 2008), or both (Manser et al. 2002;\nGriesser 2008). Accurately interpreting the information encoded in alarm calls can decrease the likelihood of predation\nfor conspecifics (Baker and Becker 2002; Templeton et al.\n2005), heterospecific group members (Hurd 1996; Templeton\nand Greene 2007); and heterospecific eavesdroppers (Lea\net al. 2008; Schmidt and Ostfeld 2008; Schmidt et al. 2008).\nAlarm calling by birds in the family Paridae has been widely\ndocumented (Hailman 1989), with most studies focusing on\nthe remarkable complexity of the alarm calls of chickadees\n(genus Poecile; Baker and Becker 2002; Freeberg and Lucas\n2002; Clucas et al. 2004; Lucas and Freeberg 2007). Chickadees utter a high-frequency low-amplitude ‘‘seet’’ call to alert\ngroup members to the presence of aerial predators and\na broadband ‘‘chick-a-dee’’ alarm call in response to perched\npredators (Templeton et al. 2005). ‘‘Chick-a-dee’’ calls are\ncomposed of a combination of 4 ordered note types that\ncan be repeated, omitted, and uttered at different rates to\ngenerate numerous unique call types that can potentially convey enormous amounts of information (Hailman 1989; Lucas\nand Freeberg 2007). Templeton et al. (2005) found that the\nacoustic structure of the ‘‘chick-a-dee’’ alarm calls of blackcapped chickadees (Poecile atricapilla) varied with the size\nand degree of threat posed by a predator, with a negative\ncorrelation between the number of ‘‘dee’’ notes in the\n‘‘chick-a-dee’’ alarm call and predator size. This variation appears to convey information about the extent of a threat, with\nsmaller and more maneuverable predators (i.e., high threat)\neliciting calls with more ‘‘dee’’ notes (Templeton et al. 2005).\nA similar degree of alarm call specificity has recently been\nreported for Carolina chickadees (P. carolinensis; Soard 2008).\nAlthough the vocal system of titmice shares many characteristics with those of chickadees (Cimprich and Grubb 1994;\nGrubb and Pravosudov 1994; Grubb 1998), little is known\nabout the possible information encoded in the alarm calls\nof tufted titmice (Baeolophus bicolor; Hill 1986; Hailman\n1989). Like chickadees, titmice utter a high-frequency lowamplitude ‘‘seet’’ call in response to aerial predators (Hailman\n1989; Krama et al. 2008) and a broadband ‘‘chick-a-dee’’ alarm\ncall in response to perched predators (Figure 1). The alarm\ncalls of tufted titmice are typically shorter in duration than\nthose of chickadees (Owens and Freeberg 2007), and the interval between ‘‘dee’’ notes in their calls (sometimes referred\nto as ‘‘broken-dee’’ notes; Smith 1972) is often more variable\nthan similar notes in chickadee alarm calls, making it more\ndifficult for researchers to accurately distinguish between calls\n(Freeberg T, personal communication). Owens and Freeberg\n(2007) identified 4 notes (Z, A, Dh, and D) that tufted titmice\ncan include in their ‘‘chick-a-dee’’ calls. These notes typically\noccur in the same sequence (Z/A/Dh/D), but, as with\nthe ‘‘chick-a-dee’’ calls of chickadees, notes can be repeated,\nomitted, and uttered at different rates to generate numerous\nunique call types (Owens and Freeberg 2007). Such variability\nin call structure suggests that titmice, like black-capped and\nCarolina chickadees, may alter the information encoded in\n‘‘chick-a-dee’’ calls by varying the number of notes.\nOur objective was to determine if tufted titmice in natural\nmixed-species flocks encode information about the size and\nAddress correspondence to G.

Our methods\nwere similar to those used by Templeton et al. (2005) in a study\nof black-capped chickadees, but we studied free-living titmice\nrather than birds in an aviary. Although aviaries provide a more\ncontrolled environment for experimentation, they may also\neliminate interactions among natural groups of species in\nmixed-species flocks that can affect mobbing responses.\nWe hypothesized that tufted titmice, like black-capped\nand Carolina chickadees, vary the number of notes in their\n‘‘chick-a-dee’’ call when responding to predators that differ in\nthe threat they pose to titmice. To test this hypothesis, we exposed titmice to a variety of avian predators, recorded their vocal\nresponses, and then analyzed the ‘‘chick-a-dee’’ calls uttered to\ndetermine if their characteristics varied predictably with the type\nof predator. We also conducted playback experiments to determine if flocks of tufted titmice responded differently to different\ntypes of ‘‘chick-a-dee’’ calls.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nTufted titmice were studied at 8 locations in Madison County,\nKentucky (lat 37°41#58##N, long 84°16#20##W), from 5 January\nto 27 February 2008 and from 12 December 2008 to 26 January\n2009. Study sites were selected based on the presence of apparently suitable habitat and included private residences (N ¼ 6),\na campground (N ¼ 1), and a private farm (N ¼ 1). Feeding\nstations were placed in woodlots on 15 December 2007, separated by a minimum distance of 1.5 km, and stocked with\nblack oil sunflower seeds to attract tufted titmice. Feeding\nstations consisted of 1 m 2 sections of plywood hung 1 m above\nground with nylon rope.\nIn our experiments, we used study skins of 5 raptors that\ndiffered in the potential threat they posed to tufted titmice,\nincluding an eastern screech-owl (Megascops asio), sharpshinned hawk (Accipiter striatus), Cooper’s hawk (A. cooperii),\ngreat horned owl (Bubo virginianus), and red-tailed hawk (Buteo jamaicensis). Great horned owls and red-tailed hawks rarely,\nif ever, prey on tufted titmice; thus, they were considered ‘‘lowthreat’’ predators, whereas the other 3 species are known\npredators of tufted titmice (Gaddis 1980; Grubb 1998; Roth\nand Lima 2007), and were considered ‘‘high-threat’’ predators. An empty platform (Baker and Becker 2002; Templeton\net al. 2005) and a study skin of a ruffed grouse (Bonasa umbellus;\na nonpredatory bird) were used as control presentations.\nPredator presentations\nTrials were conducted at each location from 5 January to 27\nFebruary 2008 and during the period from 09:00 to 14:00 h,\nwith at least 48 h between successive trials (Hill 1986). To\neliminate the possibility that interobserver differences would\ninfluence our results, all observations were made by J.R.C.\nEach trial began by placing a randomly selected raptor (or\ncontrol) in a life-like position (i.e., study skin at an angle of\nabout 70° to mimic a perched raptor) on a platform 1 m\nabove the ground and 1 m from the feeder (Baker and Becker\n2002). Specimens were initially covered with a white sheet to\nhide their identity during a 5-min prepresentation period,\nwhile the observer was positioned 5 m away. The prepresentation period began as soon as titmice were heard or observed\nwithin 25 m of the covered raptor or control and was intended\nto acclimate birds to the observer’s presence and ensure that\nbirds would remain near a feeding station long enough for an\nexperiment to be completed. After 5 min, the observer walked\nto the feeder and removed the sheet to expose the raptor or\ncontrol and then returned to the observation site to monitor\nthe behavior of titmice for 6 additional minutes.\nDuring each trial, the observer noted 1) the number of titmice present; 2) the closest distance any titmouse approached\nthe raptor or control; and 3) the time needed for flock members to return to non–mobbing behavior, that is, no alarm calls\nuttered for at least 15 s. During all trials, all ‘‘chick-a-dee’’ calls\nuttered by focal titmice were recorded using a cassette recorder\n(TCM-500DV; Sony, Tokyo, Japan) and a unidirectional microphone (ATR55; Audio-Technica, Stow, OH).\nAcoustic analysis\nRaven software (Cornell Lab of Ornithology, Ithaca, NY) was\nused to analyze the calls recorded during each trial. Mobbing\nbehavior of titmice in response to study skins was generally\nmost intense during the first 2 min of trials (Gaddis 1980)\nand, therefore, best indicated the threat level perceived by\nthe responding titmice.\nFor each trial, we attempted to identify, count, and analyze\nall alarm calls, but when multiple titmice were calling at high\nrates, calls uttered by different birds sometimes overlapped,\nand we were unable to identify each unique call. So for each\ntrial, we first counted the total number of D-notes uttered by all\ntitmice in the first 2 min of each recording. We then selected\n10 individual calls to analyze using a 120 digit random number\ntable. Random numbers corresponded to a tape location (in\nseconds, e.g., if the number 15 was selected, we used the first\ndistinct [i.e., not overlapping other calls] titmouse alarm call\nuttered 15 s after the start of the trial). If there were no calls at\nor after the selected tape location or if the call had already\nbeen analyzed, we selected another number, and corresponding tape location until 10 different calls were analyzed. If fewer\nthan 10 calls were uttered in response to a predator during a trial (N ¼ 4), means were calculated using all calls uttered.\nFor each call, we noted the number and duration of each\nnote type (Z, A, Dh, and D). However, because Dh-notes are\ngiven infrequently by titmice and have an acoustic structure\nsimilar to D-notes (Owens and Freeberg 2007), we combined\nthem with D-notes for statistical analysis. Most calls could be\neasily distinguished from other calls by the order of notes and\ndistinct breaks or intervals between calls. However, some calls\nconsisted of only D-notes and lacked Z-notes that typically indicate the start of a different call. When such calls were given in\nquick succession, distinct breaks between the D-notes of successive calls were not clear. These notes are referred to as ‘‘brokendee’’ notes (Smith 1972) and make it difficult to identify\nunique titmice alarm calls (Figure 2). When ‘‘broken-dee’’\nnotes were observed, notes separated by .0.147 s were identified, and the first of these designated the end of one call and\nthe second designated the start of a successive call. This value\n(0.147 s) represents the mean duration between second and\nFigure 1\nSonogram illustrating the ‘‘chick-a-dee’’ call (with the different note\ntypes designated as Z, A, and D, respectively) of a tufted titmouse.\nCourter and Ritchison • Titmice alarm calls 937\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/beheco/article/21/5/936/197300 by University of Maryland College Park user on 13 January 2026third D-notes plus 2 standard deviations (SDs) from an initial\nsubsample (N ¼ 150) of alarm calls that were uttered in response to high- and low-threat predators and clearly grouped\ntogether.\nStatistics\nWe used repeated measures analysis of variance to examine differences in the characteristics of ‘‘chick-a-dee’’ alarm calls\namong predator treatments. When differences were significant, a Student–Newman–Keuls (SNK) post hoc test was used\nto identify differences among treatments. All analyses were\nconducted using the Statistical Analysis System (SAS Institute\n2002–2004). To examine the possible effect of raptor size on\nthe responses of titmice, the body length of each predator was\ndetermined using information provided by Bump et al.\n(1947), Gehlbach (1995), Houston et al. (1998), and Clark\nand Wheeler (2001), and the relationships between body\nlength and the mean number of each type of note (Z, A,\nand D) in ‘‘chick-a-dee’’ calls uttered by titmice and the mean\nduration of mobbing responses were examined using linear\nregression. We used average body length rather than simply\nmeasuring the study skins because we assumed a priori that\ntitmice likely cued on a combination of species identity and\nrelative size rather than on individual size alone (Kullberg and\nLind 2002; Soard 2008).\nPlayback experiments\nTo determine if encoded information was accurately characterized, playback experiments were conducted from 12 December\n2008 to 26 February 2009 at the same 8 locations in Madison\nCounty, Kentucky, where presentation trials had been conducted previously. All experiments were conducted during\nthe period from 09:00 to 14:00 h. Beginning on 20 November\n2008, feeding stations were stocked with black oil sunflower\nseeds to attract tufted titmice. Playback tapes were made using\nhigh-quality calls of titmice recorded from each location\nduring the previous field season, responding to an eastern\nscreech-owl, a high-threat predator, and to a red-tailed hawk,\na low-threat predator. Because the calling rate and length of\nalarm calls varied in response to the 2 different predators,\nwe standardized the total duration of playback (1 min) instead\nof the total number of D-notes. Playback tapes of calls given by\ntitmice in response to the eastern screech-owl (high threat,\nN ¼ 8) contained an average of 44 calls 6 4.8 (SD) and\n183 6 17.6 D-notes, and tapes of calls given in response to\nthe red-tailed hawk (low threat, N ¼ 8) contained an average\nof 29 6 5.9 calls and 57 6 23.6 D-notes. Mobbing calls of\nAmerican robins (Turdus migratorius) (N ¼ 4) were used as\ncontrols. American robins also utter alarm calls in response\nto raptors (Shedd 1982) but do not typically associate with\nparids. High-quality calls recorded in response to predators\nfrom the previous winter (5 January to 27 February 2008) were\nplayed back to flocks at the same location during the next\nwinter (12 December 2008 to 26 January 2009) at consistent\namplitudes that approximated the natural volume of titmice\nalarm calling.\nAll playback experiments (N ¼ 24; a high threat, low threat,\nand control at each feeding station) were conducted by J.R.C.,\nand each experiment began when titmice were detected\nwithin 25 m of a feeder. Each experiment began with a\n5-min acclimation period and was followed immediately by\na 60-s playback period. Tapes were played with a cassette recorder (Sony TCM-400DV, Sony), and the speaker (SME-AFS\nportable speaker; Saul Mineroff Electronics, Elmont, NY) was\nhidden in vegetation 5 m from the feeder, and its location was\nmoved for each trial. To prevent possible differences in response due to habituation, trials at particular feeders were\nconducted at least 2 days apart, and the order of presentation\n(high-threat, low-threat, and American robin calls) was randomized. During each trial, the observer remained 5 m from\nthe playback speaker and recorded 1) the number of titmice\npresent; 2) the closest distance any titmouse approached\nthe speaker; 3) the percentage of birds in the flock that came\nwithin 3 m of the speaker; 4) the percentage of birds in\nthe flock that came within 1 m of the speaker; and 5) the time\nfrom the start of the playback trial to when flock members\nreturned to normal behavior, that, at least one titmouse landing on the feeder and selecting a seed. During all trials, all\n‘‘chick-a-dee’’ calls uttered by focal titmice were recorded.\nRESULTS\nThe mean number of titmice present during presentation trials\n(N ¼ 56) was 2.42 6 0.79 (SD) birds (range ¼ 1–5), and flocks\noften included other species, including Carolina chickadees,\nwhite-breasted nuthatches (Sitta carolinensis), and downy\nwoodpeckers (Picoides pubescens). Study skins of raptors elicited longer bouts of mobbing behavior (F6,42 ¼ 9.4,\nP , 0.0001) than controls during the 6-min trial period,\nand mobbing bouts were generally longer for smaller raptors\n(Figure 3). There was no difference in distance of closest\napproach by titmice to study skins and controls (F6,42 ¼ 1.3,\nP ¼ 0.29).\nAcoustic analyses\nOverall, we found that the mean number of notes in alarm\n(chick-a-dee) calls uttered by tufted titmice in response to\nthe study skins of predators was 4.1, including an average of\n0.58 Z-notes, 0.59 A-notes, and 2.91 D-notes. The mean number of D-notes uttered per titmouse during the first 2 min differed among predator treatments (F6,42 ¼ 10.1, P , 0.0001),\nwith significantly more D-notes uttered in response to the\neastern screech-owl, Cooper’s hawk, and sharp-shinned hawk.\nMultiple titmice were typically calling simultaneously, especially in response to these 3 species of raptors; as a result,\nvalues reported for these raptors likely underestimate actual\nFigure 2\nSonogram illustrating alarm calls uttered by tufted titmice during\na predator presentation.

Overall, we found an inverse relationship between total\nnumber of D-notes in the first 2 min of mobbing and predator\nbody length (r2 ¼ 0.81, P , 0.0001), with smaller raptors\neliciting more D-notes (Figure 4).\nThe mean number of notes in titmice alarm calls also varied\namong predator treatments (F5,30 ¼ 3.0, P , 0.025), with more\nnotes per call during trials with eastern screech-owls and\nsharp-shinned hawks. No differences, however, were found\namong predator treatments in the number of different note\ntypes per call, including Z-notes (F5,30 ¼ 1.21, P ¼ 0.33),\nA-notes (F5,30 ¼ 0.72, P ¼ 0.61), and D-notes (F5,30 ¼ 0.93,\nP ¼ 0.47). In general, the mean number of each note type\nuttered per call tended to be higher (although not significantly higher) when titmice were responding to smaller raptors, and the additive effect (i.e., more notes of each note\ntype) explains why smaller raptors elicited calls with a significantly greater number of total notes. The mean duration of\nZ-notes (F1,7 ¼ 0.02, P ¼ 0.89), A-notes (F1,7 ¼ 0.12, P ¼ 0.74),\nD1-notes (D1 ¼ first D-note; F1,7 ¼ 2.8, P ¼ 0.14), D2-notes\n(F1,7 ¼ 0.7, P ¼ 0.45), and D3-notes (F1,7 ¼ 0.02, P ¼ 0.89) did\nnot differ between calls given in response to high-threat (eastern screech-owl, sharp-shinned hawk, and Cooper’s hawk)\nand those given in response to low-threat predators (great\nhorned owl and red-tailed hawk). In addition, we found no\ndifferences in the mean interval between D1- and D2-notes\n(F1,7 ¼ 0.14, P ¼ 0.72) or D2- and D3-notes (F1,7 ¼ 0.7,\nP ¼ 0.44).\nPlayback experiments\nTufted titmice took longer (F2,14 ¼ 25.4, P , 0.0001) to return\nto normal feeding behavior during playback experiments\nwhen calls previously uttered in response to a high-threat\npredator (eastern screech-owl) were played back than during\nexperiments where calls previously uttered in response to\na low-threat predator (red-tailed hawk) were played back\n(Figure 5). The percentage of titmice in flocks that approached within 3 m of the speaker differed among trials\n(F2,14 ¼ 6.5, P ¼ 0.01), but the difference was between treatments and the control rather than between responses to playback of high-threat calls and low-threat calls (SNK; P . 0.05).\nWe found no differences among experimental treatments in\nthe percentage of titmice in flocks that approached to within\n1 m of the speaker (F2,14 ¼ 0.5, P ¼ 0.61), the number of calls\nuttered (F2,14 ¼ 2.7, P ¼ 0.10), or the total number of D-notes\nuttered (F2,14 ¼ 2.5, P ¼ 0.11).\nDISCUSSION\nTufted titmice in our study exhibited greater antipredator\nresponses to predator treatments than to controls, with longer\nbouts of mobbing and more D-notes uttered during the first\n2 min of predator trials. These results indicate that titmice distinguish between predatory and nonpredatory species (i.e., ruffed grouse). More importantly, titmice in our study appeared\nto correctly assess the degree of threat posed by different predators and conveyed this information in their alarm calls. For\nsmall birds, predator’s threat level likely corresponds to predator body size, with smaller more maneuverable raptors presenting more of a threat than larger raptors (Roth and\nLima 2007; Dial et al. 2008). In response to smaller raptors\n(eastern screech-owl, sharp-shinned hawk, and Cooper’s\nFigure 3\nMean duration (6standard error) of mobbing responses\n(in seconds) of tufted titmice responding to raptors and controls\nduring 6-min presentation periods.

Inset letters over bars show multiple comparisons\nfrom the Student–Newman–Keuls post hoc test (a ¼ 0.5), with\ndifferent letters indicating significant differences.\nCourter and Ritchison • Titmice alarm calls 939\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/beheco/article/21/5/936/197300 by University of Maryland College Park user on 13 January 2026hawk), titmice in our study uttered more D-notes during the\ninitial 2 min of mobbing and also uttered calls with more\nnotes. Similarly, Sieving et al. (2010) found that captive titmice responding to a stuffed sharp-shinned hawk and a live\neastern screech-owl uttered ‘‘chick-a-dee’’ calls with more\nD-notes than when responding to a live red rat snake (Elaphe\nguttata). However, based on the assumption that D-note production is a direct measure of perceived threat (Sieving et al.\n2010), these authors also found that the captive titmice, in\napparent contrast to our results, perceived the sharp-shinned\nhawk as greater threat than the screech-owl. A likely explanation for this is that, during their experiments, Sieving et al.\n(2010) placed caged titmice and predators just 0.75 m apart.\nAt that short distance, during the day, a fast-flying maneuverable diurnal predator like a sharp-shinned hawk would likely\nrepresent a greater threat to a titmouse than a nocturnal predator like a screech-owl.\nWe also found that the duration of mobbing bouts was generally longer when titmice were responding to smaller raptors.\nLonger and more intense mobbing bouts are likely adaptive\nand may cause a predator to evacuate the area (Pettifor\n1990), alert the predator that it has been spotted and is\nno longer a threat (Haftorn 1999), warn kin of danger\n(Bergstrom and Lachmann 2001), and facilitate cooperation\nwith conspecifics (Hurd 1996).\nOur results suggest that tufted titmice perceive eastern\nscreech-owls as a highly threatening predator. Small nocturnal\npredators, like screech-owls, may prey on titmice (Allen 1924;\nRitchison and Cavanagh 1992) when they are roosting or\nsleeping and most vulnerable. High-intensity mobbing in response to small owls has also been reported for Carolina\n(Soard 2008) and black-capped (Templeton et al. 2005) chickadees. However, in contrast to Carolina and black-capped\nchickadees, the responses of tufted titmice to sharp-shinned\nand Cooper’s hawks in our study were comparable to their\nresponses with the eastern screech-owl. This suggests that\ntufted titmice, unlike Carolina and black-capped chickadees,\nmay recognize sharp-shinned hawks, Cooper’s hawks, and\neastern screech-owls as equally dangerous predators. One possible explanation for this is that their larger size (mean body\nmass ¼ 21.5 g for tufted titmice vs. 10.5 g for Carolina chickadees; Dunning 1993; Pyle 1997) may make titmice more vulnerable to predation by sharp-shinned or Cooper’s hawks\nthan chickadees. Roth (2006) noted that sharp-shinned hawks\ngenerally do not capture prey weighing less than 20 g. In\naddition, Cooper’s hawks generally prefer larger birds, feed\nat sunrise and sunset when titmice most actively forage, and\nemploy unpredictable hunting patterns (Roth and Lima 2007,\nRoth et al. 2008 that may make them dangerous predators to\ntitmice. Mobbing responses of tufted titmice to the larger\ngreat horned owl and red-tailed hawk were generally short\nlived and less intense than responses to smaller raptors.\nWe found that the mean number of notes in alarm (chick-adee) calls uttered by tufted titmice in response to the study\nskins of predators was 4.1, including 0.58 Z-notes, 0.59 A-notes,\nand 2.91 D-notes. By comparison, for ‘‘chick-a-dee’’ calls\nuttered by tufted titmice under natural conditions (i.e., no\npredator present), Owens and Freeberg (2007) found that\nthe mean number of notes was 3.2, including 0.9 Z-notes,\n0.8 A-notes, and 1.3 D-notes. Although the possible function(s) of different note types in the ‘‘chick-a-dee’’ calls of\ntitmice is(are) not known, Owens and Freeberg (2007) suggested that Z- and A-notes may encode information about\nindividual identity. If so, when responding to predators, it\nmay be more beneficial for titmice to utter calls with more\nD-notes that convey information about the degree of threat\nand may also attract conspecifics (Hurd 1996) and cause\npredators to flee (Pettifor 1990) than to utter calls with more\nZ- and A-notes that may convey information about individual\nidentity.\nThe mean duration of notes in titmice alarm calls did not\nvary with predator threat level in our study. In contrast, blackcapped chickadees increase the duration of the ‘dee’ section\n(i.e., all D-notes) of their ‘‘chick-a-dee’’ call, shorten the duration of the first D-note, and shorten the intervals between\nthe first and second D-notes of their alarm calls in response\nto high-threat predators (Templeton et al. 2005). Carolina\nchickadees also shorten the duration of the first D-note of\nalarm calls given in response to smaller raptors, particularly\nthe eastern screech-owl (Soard 2008). Physiological constraints may prevent titmice from producing the number\nand types of calls that closely related chickadees produce\nand make titmice less able to manipulate elements of their\nalarm calls to encode fine-tuned predator information\n(Owens and Freeberg 2007). As noted previously, it is also\npossible that, in contrast to chickadees, several predators,\nincluding eastern screech-owls, sharp-shinned hawks, and\nCooper’s hawks, are high-threat predators for larger titmice,\nand as a result, differences in call elements that convey information about degree of predator threat are less pronounced for titmice than chickadees.\nThe number of individual note types (Z-, A-, and D-notes)\nper titmice alarm call did not vary among predator treatments in our study. For black-capped chickadees, the number\nof introductory notes (A-, B-, and C-notes) was found to be negatively correlated with predator body size (Templeton et al.\n2005), and for Carolina chickadees, a weak positive relationship between the number of introductory notes and predator\nbody size was reported (Soard 2008). For both black-capped\nand Carolina chickadees, strong positive relationships have\nbeen reported between the number of D-notes and predator\nthreat level, with smaller raptors eliciting calls with a great\nnumber of D-notes. For tufted titmice, we found great variability in the number of D-notes per call among predator\ntreatments and no relationship between the number of\nD-notes per calls and predator body size. Although it is possible that we incorrectly defined what titmice perceive as a\nunique call, it seems more likely that titmice perceive and\ncommunicate predator information based on the total\nnumber of D-notes uttered per unit time (including many\n‘‘broken-dee’’ notes) rather than the number of D-notes per\ncall, as reported for black-capped and Carolina chickadees\n(Templeton et al. 2005; Soard 2008).\nIn mixed-flock contexts, a combination of different alarming calling techniques may enhance mobbing effectiveness\nof a group (Goodale and Kotagama 2005, 2008). Chickadee\nalarm calls, containing D-notes that range from 2 to 4 kHz in\nfrequency and vary in number with respect to predator threat,\nappear well suited to attract conspecifics and heterospecific\nflockmates whose auditory sensitivities are typically greatest\nfrom 2 to 3 kHz (Henry and Lucas 2008). Although titmice\nalarm calls also convey information about predators and attract flockmates, D-notes in titmice alarm calls also extend\nover a wider range of frequencies (1–8 kHz; Owens and\nFreeberg 2007) that may easily be received by a variety of\npredators, ranging from small hawks that hear best at low\nfrequencies (1–4 kHz) to larger owls that hear best at high\nfrequencies (7–8 kHz; Krama et al. 2008). Broadband D-notes\nof titmice alarm calls, with unpredictable breaks between successive notes (i.e., ‘‘broken-dees’’), may be better suited to\nconfuse and frustrate predators. The unpredictable presentation of these notes in ‘‘broken-dee’’ calls might make it difficult for a predator to identify individual titmouse alarm calls\nand cause a predator to overestimate the number of titmice\ncalling, thereby increasing the likelihood that a predator\nwould leave an area (Bildstein 1982; Pavey and Smyth 1998).\n940 Behavioral Ecology\nDownloaded from https://academic.oup.com/beheco/article/21/5/936/197300 by University of Maryland College Park user on 13 January 2026Titmice in our study took longer to return to normal feeding\nbehavior after the playback of alarm calls previously uttered in\nresponse to the presence of a high-threat predator (eastern\nscreech-owl), indicating that information about threat level\nhad been conveyed by the alarm calls. However, in response\nto playback of alarm calls previously given in response to\na high-threat and low-threat predator, titmice in our study,\nin contrast black-capped (Templeton et al. 2005) and Carolina\n(Soard 2008) chickadees, exhibited no differences in either\napproach distance or the number of calls uttered. If they are\nat greater risk of predation than the smaller chickadees because of their larger size, titmice may be less willing to approach a playback speaker or call when they lack visual cues\nof predation. For example, Lind et al. (2005) reported that\ncaptive great tits (mean body mass ¼ 19.0 vs. 21.5 g of tufted\ntitmouse; Lange and Leimar 2004) that only heard alarm calls\nremained still, whereas those that saw a perched predator\nuttered loud mobbing calls.\nLike black-capped and Carolina chickadees, tufted titmice\nencode information in their ‘‘chick-a-dee’’ alarm calls that is\nboth functionally referential and contains information about\nthe level of threat posed by a potential predator. Titmice,\nhowever, may be less flexible in manipulating the duration\nof the various elements of their alarm calls and appear to\ncommunicate and perceive information in alarm calls differently than closely related chickadee species. In conveying information about the degree of threat posed by a perched\nraptor, tufted titmice appear to vary the total number of\nD-notes uttered per unit time rather than varying other characteristics of their alarm calls. Additional study is needed to\ndetermine if this difference between chickadees and titmice\ntranslates into a difference in how each species conveys\ninformation to heterospecifics and conspecifics in predator\ndefense contexts.\nFUNDING\nKentucky Ornithological Society (Burt Monroe, Jr Avian\nResearch Grant).\nWe thank Chad Soard for assistance in developing our methods,\nLynn Courter, Marc Reyes, and Olivia Reyes for help with the fieldwork, Christine Lattin for assistance with acoustic analysis, and Nick\nSantangelo, Daiqin Li, and 3 anonymous reviewers for many helpful\ncomments.\nREFERENCES\nAllen AA. 1924.

In spite of its importance for understanding of\nmammalian societies, the coding of individual-related information in the vocal signals of non-primate mammals\nhas been relatively neglected. The present study focuses on the spotted hyena Crocuta crocuta, a social carnivore\nknown for its complex female-dominated society. We investigate if and how the well-known hyena’s laugh, also\nknown as the giggle call, encodes information about the emitter.\nResults: By analyzing acoustic structure in both temporal and frequency domains, we show that the hyena’s laugh\ncan encode information about age, individual identity and dominant/subordinate status, providing cues to\nreceivers that could enable assessment of the social position of an emitting individual.\nConclusions: The range of messages encoded in the hyena’s laugh is likely to play a role during social\ninteractions. This call, together with other vocalizations and other sensory channels, should ensure an array of\ncommunication signals that support the complex social system of the spotted hyena. Experimental studies are now\nneeded to decipher precisely the communication network of this species.\nBackground\nThe origin and maintenance of social group structure is\na topic of central concern in vertebrate biology [1-4].\nWhereas one approach is to understand the processes\nthat can account for sociality over an evolutionary scale\n[5-8], a proximal point of view aims to decipher the\nmechanisms by which the social structure of a group is\nmaintained -or not- over an individual lifetime scale\n[9-13]. Since Darwin’s book on the expression of emotion [14] and followed by numerous studies in the field,\nit is well known that information on social status can\nhelp individuals adjust their behaviour, for example by\navoiding useless fights and polishing social interactions\n[15-17]. Chemical, visual and acoustic signals have been\nshown to encode information about sex, kinship, individual identity, morphological cues, as well as motivational and physiological states of the sender [18-28]. As\nsome of these cues can potentially be correlated to fighting ability and dominance rank, the information helps\ncongeners evaluate the emitter’s social position within\nthe group [18,29-38]. We extended these studies by\nexamining the information that is present in one of the\nacoustic communication signals of a unique social carnivore, the spotted hyena Crocuta crocuta. Spotted hyenas\nare nocturnal social carnivores, typically living in multimale, multi-female, “clans” of 10 - 90 individuals.\nSpotted hyenas are efficient hunters. A lone hyena is\ncapable of capturing prey as large as a wildebeest. Hyenas will also hunt collaboratively, for example to catch\nzebras [39]. But both sole and collaborative hunting can\ngenerate intense competition as clan mates will converge on the carcass. Spotted hyenas have a matrilineal\nsocial system similar to that of many old world primates\n[40]. Within spotted hyena clans, there are separate\nmale and female dominance hierarchies, but all females,\nand their sub-adult offspring, totally dominate all adult\nimmigrant males. Such female dominance persists in the\ncaptive colony at the University of California, Berkeley,\n* Correspondence: theunissen@berkeley.edu\n† Contributed equally\n3\nUniversity of California at Berkeley, Helen Wills Neuroscience Institute,\nBerkeley, USA\nMathevon et al.

This colony was established in order to permit the study of the endocrine substrates of dominance and aggression, as well as the basis\nof “masculinization” of the external genitalia of female\nspotted hyena, which occurs in utero [41].\nIn nature, the dominance hierarchies described above\ndetermine priority of access to food. The hierarchical\nposition of an individual is fully acquired around 18\nmonths of age and is not correlated with size or fighting\nability: the social status of females is determined by\ntheir mothers’ social rank [42-44], whereas males’ one\ndepends on their sequence of arrival within the social\ngroup [45,46]. During their entire life, hyenas form coalitions against competitors to defend their social ranks\n[47]. Within their clan, individuals have to cope with a\ncomplicated network of social congeners, and this promotes the development of effective abilities to discriminate and rank congeners. Although, it is known that\nhyenas communicate through visual, chemical and\nacoustical modalities, there is still much to learn about\nthe nature of exchanged information and the way it is\nencoded into communication signals [48].\nOne of the most striking hyena communication channels is acoustical [39]. These animals are well known for\ntheir vocalizations that dominate the nightly soundscape\nin the African savannah. The vocal repertoire of the\nspotted hyena is large, with more than ten different\nvocalizations, many of them being graded into each\nother which makes them difficult to be classified [39,49].\nAs hyenas are primarily nocturnal [50], vocal signalling\nis a privileged channel, used for both long- and shortrange communications. For instance, “whoops,” with\nlong inter-whoop intervals, are primarily used to signal\nseparated individuals, supporting within- and betweenclans acoustic interaction [51,52]; conversely, the “grunt”\n[39] (\"soft growl” in [49]) is uttered during close meeting of clan mates and remains barely audible after a few\nmeters of propagation. Previous studies have focused on\nthe long-distance “whoop” call, showing that it supports\ninformation related to sex and individual identity and\nthus may allow discrimination between clan members\nand alien individuals [48,51,53]. Although they might\nplay an important role in mediating the relationships\nwithin the clan, calls, other than the whoop, of adult\nhyenas have been neglected. Although inferences have\nbeen drawn from the contexts in which the various\nvocalizations are emitted, the information that such\nvocalizations contain has not yet been investigated [48].\nAmong the vocalizations used during interactions\nbetween adult clan-mates, we chose to focus on the\n“giggle call”, often referred as the hyena’s laugh (Figures\n1 (see additional files 1, 2, 3 &4 for sound) 2 (see additional files 5, 6, 7 &8 for sound); [39]). Giggles are high\npitched sounds emitted in bouts, mainly when hyenas\nare feeding together on a prey [39,49]. This call has\nbeen described by field observers as a submissive vocalization uttered by an individual in front of a dominant\n[39,49]. Although giggles are emitted during close-range\ninteractions between two or more individuals, they are\nloud and can be easily eavesdropped by other clanmates. In nature, giggles are commonly emitted during\ncompetitions between dominant and subordinate animals such as those that would occur for food at a carcass [39,49], but identification of individual giggles by\nhuman observers is difficult because of the simultaneous\nemission of such giggles by multiple individuals. In the\nBerkeley colony, it was possible to record giggles\nemitted by individual hyenas when presented with food.\nIn the present report, we describe the use of acoustic\nstructure analysis, in order to determine whether the\ngiggle of spotted hyenas encodes information about sex,\nage, dominance and individual identity, and if it could\nallow congeners to assess an emitter’s social status\nbased on its laughing cues.\nMethods\nSubjects\nThe animals that participated in the study are members\nof a captive breeding colony of spotted hyenas, maintained at the Field Station for the Study of Behavior,\nEcology, and Reproduction (FSSBER) at the University\nof California, Berkeley. Currently, this colony houses 26\nhyenas: 14 adult females, 10 adult males, and 2 subadult males (less than two years of age at the time of\ntesting). Animals are sexed and their life history is\nknown. The reproductive founders of the Berkeley colony were collected in 1985 in the Narok district of\nKenya. The present study was conducted in SeptemberOctober 2008, and all the animals currently at the field\nstation were born in captivity. The FSSBER is fully\naccredited by the American Association for the Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care and the animal care\nalso met all institutional guidelines. The behavioural\nprocedures were approved by the Institutional Animal\nCare and Use Committee (IACUC) of the University of\nCalifornia, Berkeley.\nIn the field station, individuals are housed in groups\nof two (n = 7 dyads) or three (n = 1 one triad) in outdoor or semi-outdoor enclosures (enclosure mean area\n= 330 m 2 , min-max = 147-929 m 2 ). Table 1 provides\ndetailed for information about individuals whose giggles\nwere analyzed in the present report. The dominance\nstatus within each dyad was assessed on a daily basis by\ncaretakers familiar with the animals. There was perfect\nagreement between two caretakers who independently\nassigned dominance ranks, based upon observation of\nsubmissive (e.g., retreat, tail between legs) and aggressive acts (e.g., push, stand over, chase). For each dyad,\nMathevon et al. BMC Ecology 2010, 10:9\nhttp://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6785/10/9\nPage 2 of 16Figure 1 Acoustic structure of the hyena’s giggle (laughing) call. A.

Thus although the hormonal and\ndevelopmental state of the animals were not a designed\nfactor in our study, the effect of these treatments had\nto be examined so that they could be discarded (or\nalternatively further examined if they had showed\ninteresting results). The animals in the study were\ninitially assigned to the following groups: (A) “control”\n(no treatment or simple vasectomy; 2 males, 3\nfemales), (B) treatment with “anti-androgens” (flutamide and finasteride, or Casodex and finasteride) in\nutero (3 males, 7 females; for details of drug treatments, see [55]); or (C) treatment with an aromatase\ninhibitor (Letrozole, preventing the synthesis of estrogen) in utero (1 male, 1 female; for details of Letrozole\ntreatment see [56]). In addition, (D)1 male and 1\nfemale were gonadectomized during the first months\nof life. When compared with control hyenas, gonadectomized hyenas would have had low concentrations of\nplasma testosterone, or estradiol, at the time of testing\n[57]. Male hyenas treated with anti-androgens in utero\nhave reduced concentrations of testosterone as adults\n[58]; while female spotted hyenas treated with antiandrogens in utero displayed elevated concentrations\nof estradiol [58]. In Hyenas, males are mature at 2\nyears old, and females at 3 (Glickman, pers. obs.).\nFigure 2 A second example of the hyena’s giggle call for two experimental animals. A majority of animals used in this study were treated\nwith hormones or gonadectomized as participants in other research projects. In this figure, we show two giggle bouts emitted by two different\nindividuals, Winnie and Kadogo. Winnie is a 14 yr old male treated with anti-androgens in utero. Kadogo is a 6 year old female treated with antioestrogens in utero. Hormonal treatment did not have an effect on the acoustical structure of the giggle notes or giggle bouts as assessed by\nour measures. Winnie is a subordinate animal while Kadogo is a dominant animal. The sounds of the giggle bouts for Winnie are available as\nAdditional Files 5 and 6. The sounds of the giggle bouts for Kadogo are available as Additional Files 7 and 8.\nMathevon et al. BMC Ecology 2010, 10:9\nhttp://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6785/10/9\nPage 4 of 16To test the effect of hormonal treatments, we performed statistical analyses by dividing the animals into\nthe four groups mentioned above. Alternatively, we analyzed the data by dividing the experimental animals into\ntwo groups (anti-estrogen and anti-androgens) by\nincluding the two gonadectomized animals into these\ngroups (the female into the anti-estrogen and the male\nin the anti-androgen group). Finally, we also tested the\ncontrol animals against all experimental animals. These\nvarious groupings were done to potentially increase the\nstatistical power of the tests given the small sample size\nin each group. As described below, none of the analyses\nrevealed an effect of hormonal treatment.\nVocalizations recordings\nWe recorded hyena’s vocalizations in the morning, prior\nto feeding (recording chain: Shure Model 16A condenser microphone placed at 3-5 meters from the vocalizing\nanimal, connected to a MARANTZ PMD670 solid state\nrecorder; sampling frequency = 44100 Hz; frequency\nresponse of the recording chain: ± 2.5 dB over the 50 to\n15,000 Hz frequency range). Giggling was elicited by\nteasing the focused animal with a bone or a piece of\nmeat presented through the fence of the enclosure. In\nmost cases (and in particular for subordinate animals),\nthe recorded animal was isolated from its cage-mate to\navoid fights and potential injuries.\nTo limit the potential impact of pseudo-replication, each\nindividual was recorded over a minimum of 4 different\ndays (10 females, 7 males; see Table 1 for details). Giggles\nare emitted in bouts which consist of a rapid succession of\nvery short calls or notes (Figure 1A &2). In this study, we\nfocused our analysis on the information that could be\nextracted from both the average acoustical features of single notes and from features describing the range of giggle\nnotes produced by single animals. Although, there is certainly additional information in the structure of a particular sequence of notes within bouts these were not\nexamined in this analysis; analyzing such sequence effects\nwould require the estimation of transition probabilities for\nparticular note types and this initial data set is too small\nfor such characterization. The notes used for the analysis\nwere selected pseudo-randomly from the recordings to\navoid noisy or transitional sounds such as whines within\nthe giggles. The raw data consisted of 254 giggle bouts\nand a total of 1807 notes (Average notes/bout = 7.1, Standard deviation = 4.1). The final data set consisted of 41 ±\n19 (std) notes per individual (minimum = 20; maximum =\n98), or a total of 695 notes. Balanced statistical analyses\nwere performed by repeatedly choosing 20 random notes\nfor each animal.\nSound analysis\nTo characterize the giggle notes’ complex acoustic structure, we performed the measurement of 13 variables, in\nboth temporal and frequency domains (Figure 1B, C).\nThe acoustical analysis was done using custom software\nwritten in MATLAB (Ver 7.6, The Mathworks,\nTable 1 List and characteristics of recorded hyenas.\nAnimal name and number Sex Age\n(years)\nTreatment Experimental\ngroup\nDominant (D)/\nSubordinate (S)\nNumber of analysed\ngiggle notes\n#30 Rocco (lives with Domino) male 20 vasectomized Control S 20\n#57 Gremlin (lives with Kadogo) male 14 Flut Anti-androgen S 98\n#59 Winnie (lives with Kombo) male 14 Flut&Fin Anti-androgen S 40\n#64 Dusty (lives with Denali) male 11 gonadectomized gonadectomized D 35\n#65 Denali (lives with Dusty) male 11 Control Control S 27\n#82 Buster (lives with BJ) male 7 Letrozole Anti-oestrogen S 52\n#55 Nakuru (lives with Nairobi) female 14 Flut&Fin Anti-androgen S 26\n#56 Nairobi (lives with Nakuru) female 14 Flut&Fin Anti-androgen D 31\n#61 Domino (lives with Rocco) female 13 Flut&Fin Anti-androgen D 63\n#63 BJ (lives with Buster) female 12 gonadectomized gonadectomized D 33\n#68 Ursa (lives with Cass) female 10 Control Control S 53\n#71 Cass (lives with Ursa) female 10 Control Control D 55\n#77 Kombo (lives with Winnie) female 9 Control Control D 42\n#83 Kadogo (lives with Gremlin) female 6 Letrozole Anti-oestrogen D 33\n#90 Tembo (lives with Haji and Jambo) male 2 Fin&Csdx Anti-androgen S 26\n#91 Haji (lives with Tembo and Jambo) female 2 Fin&Csdx Anti-androgen S 21\n#92 Jambo (lives with Tembo and Haji) female 2 Fin&Csdx Anti-androgen D 40\nMathevon et al. BMC Ecology 2010, 10:9\nhttp://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6785/10/9\nPage 5 of 16Cambridge MA). The time-varying fundamental frequency of notes was extracted using a custom algorithm\nthat combined two separate measurements of fundamental frequency to obtain a best guess using a Bayesian\napproach. The two methods were: 1) a cepstral analysis\nwhere the inverse time corresponding to the highest\npeak in the Fourier transform of the log spectrogram\nwas taken as the fundamental, and 2) a direct analysis of\nthe short-time Fourier Transform (STFT) of the sound\nwaveform where the smallest distance between all major\nsuccessive peaks including a peak at zero was taken as\nthe fundamental. The spectrogram and the STFT where\nobtained with Gaussian shaped windows with a timefrequency scale of 3.2 ms/50 Hz measured by the standard deviation parameter of the Gaussian window in\ntime or frequency. The Bayesian approach consisted of\nassigning a likelihood to each of these two measurements and a prior. The likelihood was obtained by estimating the probability of the possible fundamental\nfrequencies given the relative size of the peaks in the\ncepstrum or STFT. The prior depended on previous history, more precisely on the local derivative of the fundamental obtained from the prior three measurements\n(the prior was uniform for fundamental below 1 kHz for\nthe initial measurements). The algorithm returned the\nbest guess of the fundamental and its probability.\nGuesses with low probabilities were dismissed as sounds\nlacking clear periodicity. The performance of the algorithm was verified visually for all calls in the database\nand was deemed to perform very similarly to what an\nexpert acoustician might extract from analyzing the\nspectrogram. Using this methodology, we extracted the\ntime-varying fundamental frequency of each note in our\ndata set with a (over-sampled) resolution of 1 ms. The\nfollowing parameters were then calculated from these\ndata: mean of the fundamental frequencies (‘Mean F’),\nmaximum of the fundamental frequencies (‘Max F’),\nminimum of the fundamental frequencies (‘Min F’) and\nthe coefficient of variation of the fundamental frequencies (‘CV F’). We also extracted acoustical parameters\nfrom the frequency spectrum obtained for entire notes.\nThe frequency spectrum was calculated with the Welch\naverage periodogram method using a 23.2 ms Hanning\nwindow [59]. From the frequency spectrum, we measured the frequencies corresponding to the first, second\nand third quartiles of energy (‘Q1’, ‘Q2’, ‘Q3’, respectively), the mean frequency (‘Mean S’), and the standard\ndeviation of the spectrum (‘SD S’). We also extruded\nthree additional measures of spectral shape: skewness,\nkurtosis and entropy. The spectrum skewness (‘Skew’)\nwas calculated as Skew   \n\n p f f fi\ni\nN\ni( )( )\n1\n3 13\n ; the\nspectrum kurtosis (’Kurt’) was calculated as\nKurt   \n\n p f f fi i\ni\nN\n( )( ) 4\n1\n1\n4\n , where f i = frequencies, p\n(fi) = the normalized power spectrum ( ( ( ) )p f i\ni\nN\n\n\n 1\n1\n)\nand s2 is the variance of the spectrum given by\n 2\n1\n2\n \n\n p f f fi\ni\nN\ni( )( ) . The spectral entropy (‘Ent’) was\ncalculated as Ent   \n p fi p fi\ni\nN\nN\n( ) log ( ( ))\nlog ( )\n2\n1\n2\n. These values of\nspectral shape have been recently proposed for acoustical analysis (Seewave R software http://rug.mnhn.fr/seewave[60]). Sound duration (‘Dur’) of each note was\nmeasured visually from the oscillogram and its corresponding spectrogram.\nAll measures described above are used to describe the\nacoustical structure of single notes, or when averaged to\ndescribe giggles notes produced by an individual, as a\nprototypical single giggle note. However, it is clear from\nexperiencing giggle sounds (personal experience), or, for\nthe reader of this article by visual inspection of spectrograms (Figure 1 &2) as well as listening to the example\nsound clips (see Additional Files) that individual hyenas\nmodulate both the fundamental frequency (pitch) and\nthe type of giggle note (timbre) that they produce. The\nstructure present in the succession of giggles notes in a\nbout is rich, almost musical, and potentially very informative. In this study, we just began the analysis of this\nstructure by calculating the coefficient of variation (CV)\nof the mean fundamental frequency (‘CVMeanF’) and of\nthe spectral mean (‘CVMeanS’) from all the giggle notes\nobtained from each individual. In other words, for each\nhyena, we calculated from all its giggle notes, one\nCVMeanF and one CVMeanS. These measures provide\na simple quantitative measurement of how much each\nindividual varies the pitch and the timbre of the giggle\nnote that it produces. Since the CV is obtained by dividing the standard deviation by the mean, we also\nobtained the mean of ‘Mean F’ (‘GrandMeanF’), the\nstandard deviation of ‘Mean F’ (‘SDMeanF’), the mean\nof ‘Mean S’ (‘GrandMeanS’) and standard deviation of\n‘Mean S’ (‘SDMeanS’). We examined these means and\nstandard deviations to assess their respective contribution to the coefficient of variance.\nStatistical analysis\nFor all multivariate statistical analyses, the raw values of\nthe 13 acoustical parameters of interest were centred\nand normalized (i.e. transformed into z-scores) to insure\ncorrect weighting since our acoustical parameters had\ndifferent units (e.g., ‘Mean F’ and ‘CV F’). Normality was\nvisually inspected using the “normplot” command in\nMatlab.\nWe analyzed the differences between giggles notes\nfrom different individuals or groups of individuals using\nMathevon et al. BMC Ecology 2010, 10:9\nhttp://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6785/10/9\nPage 6 of 16Discriminant Function Analysis (DFA) [61]. The DFA\nwas performed in Matlab (using the functions ‘manova’,\nand ‘classify’) and repeated in R for further validation as\nexplained below. A DFA is composed of two steps: in\nthe first step a set of discriminant functions is obtained\nfrom a training data set; in the second step these functions are used to test classification on a validation set.\nWe chose the linear discriminant functions given by the\neigenvectors of the ratio of the between and within covariance matrices; this approach is equivalent to a multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA). The MANOVA\nassumes a jointly normal distribution for the parameters\nthat describe the variability between and within individuals and returns the number of significant discriminant\nfunctions. The statistical significance of the functions is\nassessed by assuming normal distributions and calculating Wilk’s lambda test statistic. In the second step, these\ndiscriminant functions are then used to classify giggle\nnotes chosen from a validation data set. This cross-validation step gives a measure of the effect size (the percent correct) and of the statistical significance by\ncomparing the percent correct and its standard error to\nchance. The measure of standard error is obtained by\nanalyzing the percent correct assignment of 100 random\nselections of the original data set divided into a fitting\nand testing set. In all cases the training set consisted of\n19 randomly selected giggle notes per animal and the\ndiscrimination was tested on a different randomly\nselected note (Note 19+1 = 20, the smallest number of\nnotes that we obtained for an animal in our data set).\nAs shown in Figure 3 and Results, 100 random selections were more than sufficient to obtain good estimates. By performing this cross-validation step, not only\ndoes one obtain a desirable measure of effect size (the\npercent correct) but also the assumption of normality is\nrelaxed.\nFrom the cross-validation results, we could also\nextract a complete confusion matrix: the conditional\nprobability of guessing that the test giggle note came\nfrom individual i when in fact it was emitted by j:\nconfusion i j p i j( , ) ( | )\nFrom the confusion matrix, one can also obtain a\nmeasure of the goodness of the classification (effect size)\nby estimating the mutual information between guesses\nand actual values [62]:\nMI p i j\np i p j\ni j\n \n\n \n\nlog ( , )\n( ) ( )\n,\n2\nHere the probability of the actual values, p(j), is uniform because the same number of testing giggles is used\nfor each individual or group. When the DFA is used to\nclassify individuals (n = 17), p(j) = 1/17 = 0.058. p(i, j)\nand p(i) are obtained from the confusion matrix and\nBayes’ theorem. It should be noted that the MI will have\na positive bias for small number of testing notes and will\nhave a negative bias (or be bounded) when the number\nof individuals is too small. For example, for 17 individuals, the upper bound for estimate of MI from the\nconfusion matrix is log 2 (17) = 4.75 bits. As shown in\nthe results, we were far from the regime were the negative bias becomes important and we corrected for positive bias effects. The measure of effect size provided by\nthe MI is then independent of the number of animals or\ncalls and, moreover, can be normalized by the length of\nthe sound (by division) to get an effect size in bits/s. It\ncan therefore be used to compare results on the information bearing content of communication sounds\nacross experiments and species.\nThe straightforward DFA described above was used to\nevaluate the information present in giggle notes about\nindividual identity. However, this procedure needs to be\nfurther modified when DFA is used to assess differences\namong groups of individuals classified by their age,\nsocial status or treatment effect. For those analyses,\nthere are two additional statistical considerations:\npseudo-replication and nested and/or interacting effects.\nThe pseudo-replication comes from the fact that, when\nanalyzing effects other than individual identity, giggle\nnotes from the same animal are not statistically independent measures. In fact, the individual identity is a\nnested effect: one needs to consider differences in notes\nfrom different individuals as a separate effect that might\nexplain some or all of the differences observed between\ngroups. This point was clearly made by Mundry and\nSommer [63] who suggested addressing the nested individual factor in a DFA by comparing the percent correct\nobtained in the analysis to the distribution of percent\ncorrect values obtained by randomly assigning the group\nidentity to each individual. In our analysis, this distribution was obtained from 1000 randomly created data sets\nwhere the group identity of each individual is permuted\nin each set while preserving the number in each group.\nNote that in the random sets any information that is\ndependent on identity (such as belonging to a particular\ndyad) is also lost. This procedure is called permuted\nDFA (pDFA). The pDFA was performed in Matlab and\nalso calculated with a R routine provided by Roger\nMundry [63]. The statistical conclusions from both the\nMatlab and R routines were identical although we did\nobserve small differences in the percent correct measures. In this study, we report the results obtained from\nthe Matlab routines.\nTo further examine the potential interaction between\nthe individual differences and the different conditions\n(age, sex, dominance, treatment), we performed a\nMathevon et al.

By using the average\nvalue for each individual in the regression we eliminated\nthe pseudo replication problem that could lead to\ninflated significance. To minimize the number of statistical tests, this regression was performed for the first\ndiscriminant function, then the second, and so forth\nuntil we failed to find an effect. When age was a significant factor, we also used an analysis of covariance\n(ANCOVA) as an exploratory tool to investigate potential interactions between age and the other independent\nvariables; in the ANCOVA age is treated as a regular\nscale variable in linear regression and the other conditions are examined to determine whether separate lines\nfor each condition are warranted (the interaction effect).\nThe p-values were then adjusted for multiple tests using\nthe Bonferronni correction.\nWe also performed six linear regression analyses\n(least-square and robust) with ‘GrandMeanF’,\n‘SDMeanF’, ‘GrandMeanS’, ‘SDMeanS’ “CVMeanF” and\n“CVMeanS” as dependent variables and age, sex, dominance and treatment as predictor variables. The p-values\nwere corrected for multiple tests using the Benjamini\nand Hochberg False Discovery Rate [64]. ANCOVA was\nthen used to examine the presence of interaction effects\nbetween age and other predictor variables when age was\na significant factor in the linear stepwise regression analysis. Finally, considering that the dominance/subordinate status was assessed for each individual in respect to\nits cage-mate, we performed paired t-tests considering\nhyena dyads. For the single triad in our data (see table\n1), Jambo was assessed as being dominant over his two\ncage mates, Tembo and Haji; thus, we took the average\nacoustical parameters of Tembo and Haji to characterize\nthe subordinate call.\nResults\nGiggle note acoustic structure\nAll analyzed giggle notes (n = 695) showed the same\ngeneral structure, i.e., short, broad-band signals, with\nsome modulation in frequency (Figure 1B). Average\nnote duration was 69 ± 18 ms (mean ± standard deviation). The mean fundamental frequency was 547 ± 146\nHz, with a maximum of 741 ± 180 Hz and a minimum\nof 399 ± 143 Hz. The fundamental frequency was\nmodulated in time with a coefficient of variation of\n0.155 ± 0.101. The energy was concentrated on the\nlower- harmonics as the frequency values at the first\n(25%), second (50%) and third (75%) quartiles of energy\nare 635 ± 398 Hz, 848 ± 556 Hz, and 1196 ± 717 Hz\nrespectively. However, this distribution showed great\nvariation among individuals. For example, the frequency\nat the third quartile ranged from 754 ± 315 Hz to\n2279 ± 996 Hz, depending on individuals. The spectrum\nmean frequency was 979 ± 495 Hz, with a mean standard deviation of 544 ± 229 Hz. The frequency spectrum showed a positive skewness (skew equals 2.56 ±\n1.93), underlying that most of the energy was concentrated over the low part of the signal frequency bandwidth. The leptokurticity of the spectrum (kurtosis of\n18.5 ± 24.5) and the low values of spectral entropy\n(0.52 ± 0.12) quantify the fact that the energy was concentrated at a few frequency values (peaks). Differences\nin giggle notes from different individuals are illustrated\nin Figure 1A and 2 where giggle bouts from four individuals are shown: as can be seen the two bouts coming\nfrom the same individual bared similarities while two\nbouts coming from different individuals were clearly\nmore distinct.\nAcoustic Structure in Succession of Giggle Notes\nGiggle notes are produced in bouts as shown in figures\n1 and 2. In our experiment, a typical giggle bout lasted\nless than 1 second and had approximately 7 notes\n(Avg = 7.1 notes/bout). The longest bout we recorded\nlasted 4s and had 28 notes. The shortest had two notes\nand lasted 200 ms.\nThe sequence of notes in a giggle bout has also a rich\nacoustic structure, in the sense that both the pitch and\nthe timbre of giggle notes appear to change in an\norderly fashion from the first to the last note in a bout.\nIn this study, we coarsely began to quantify this structure by examining the variability in the mean fundamental and the spectrum mean frequency for each\nindividual. The values for those two measurements are\nshown in the top panels in Figure 1A for the succession\nof giggle notes for the first example bout for each animal. In these examples, Ursa varied the mean fundamental (F) and the spectrum mean frequency (S) across\nits giggle notes more than did Kombo. It can also be\nclearly observed in the spectrogram that within a giggle\nbout, Ursa used more different “types” of notes than\nKombo (see also the corresponding example sound\nclips). The same difference can be observed between the\ngiggle notes produce by Winnie (more variable) and\nKadogo shown in figure 2. Ursa and Winnie were subordinate animals while Kombo and Kadogo were dominant animals. Ursa and Kombo (shown in figure 1) were\ncontrol animals while Winnie and Kadogo (shown in\nfigure 2) were treated with anti-androgen and anti-estrogens respectively. We will show below that dominance\nstatus and age both affect the variability of giggle notes\nwithin animals but that hormonal treatment did not\nappear to affect the acoustic structure of giggle vocalizations as described by the measures we used. Across all\nanimals, the mean CV for the mean fundamental was\nMathevon et al. BMC Ecology 2010, 10:9\nhttp://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6785/10/9\nPage 9 of 160.19+- 0.05 (Range: 0.12-0.34). The mean CV for the\nspectrum mean frequency was 0.35+-0.1 (Range: 0.220.57).\nIndividual identity and age of the sender\nThe DFA identified significant acoustic differences\nbetween individuals, calculating eight significant linear\ndiscriminant functions that allowed maximizing individual separation (Figure 3A). Table 2 shows the variance\nexplained by each of the eight functions and the variable\nloadings on each function for the three most important\nfactors. The spectrum mean frequency and the mean\nfundamental were the two main factors that separated\nindividuals on the first function. The second function\nrelied on the spectrum standard deviation, the note\nduration and the third quartile of energy, while the third\nfunction depended on the spectrum standard deviation,\nthe spectral entropy, and the mean fundamental. Thus,\nwhile the first function mostly reflected the fundamental\nfrequency (pitch), the second and third function quantified the spectral envelope (one of the factors that affect\ntimbre).\nThe results of the cross-validation step showed that,\nalthough perfect individual identification was not\nachieved, the rate of success was greatly above chance\n(32% versus 6%) (Figure 3C). This is not surprising\ngiven the high number of significant acoustical parameters. However, there was also extensive variation in\nthe classification success rate across individuals (average = 32%, individual range from 6% to 62%). In other\nwords, in our sample, some animals appeared to produce similar giggle notes (e.g see Kadogo, Rocco and\nNakuru in Figure 3A and 3B) and were thus not easily\nclassified while other animals produced relatively\nunique vocalizations (e.g. Jambo, Kombo and BJ in Figure 3A and 3B).\nTo obtain another measure of effect size that could be\nused to compare with other studies, we also calculated\nthe mutual information from the confusion matrix that\nshows the joint probability of the actual and predicted\nindividuals in cross-validated data (Figure 3B). The\nmutual information was 1.09 bits (well below the ceiling\nvalue or log 2 (17) = 4.08 bits). Since this information was\nobtained for single giggle notes of average duration of\n69 ms, the resulting baud rate is 15.8 bits/s. A mutual\ninformation of ~1 bit/giggle means that a giggle note\ncarries the same amount of information as a variable\nthat would be able to perfectly divide any hyena as\nbelonging into one of two groups. For giggles, this same\namount of information actually allows one to associate\nthe hyena as belonging to one of many groups but not\nwith 100% accuracy (for example in our study as 1 of 17\nindividuals but with 37% accuracy) [62].\nThe post-hoc linear regression with age, gender, dominance and treatment as predictor variables and the first\ndiscriminant function as a dependent variable was not\nstatistically significant (F(4,12) = 2.4, p = 0.1) but we\nnoted that the coefficient for age was significant both\nfor the least-square and robust regression methods (p =\n0.01 and p = 0.03 respectively). Older animals had lower\nvalues for the first function than younger animals (Figure 3D, left panel), which, given the loadings of this\nfunction, appears to reflect a lowering of the fundamental with age (see Figure 3D right panel and also below).\nThe ANCOVA confirm the statistically significant effect\nof age (F(1,15) = 10.4, p = 0.005) but showed no statistically significant interaction between age and the other\nconditions (sex, dominance, treatment). The linear\nregression did not reveal any statistically significant factors for the second discriminant function and the other\ndiscriminant functions were therefore not tested to\nminimize the number of tests and prevent the risk of\nfalse positives. Thus, while the first function might be\nused to classify individuals based on their age, the other\ndiscriminant functions capture idiosyncratic features of\neach individual’s giggles.\nTable 2 MANOVA results.\nSorted Dimension P % Variance Function Loadings\n1 < 10 -3 42.1 0.860 Mean S + 0.676 Mean F + 0.363 Min F\n2 < 10 -3 22.2 (64.3) 1.011 SD S - 0.787 Dur - 0.493 Q3\n3 < 10 -3 11.6 (75.9) 1.449 SD S - 1.200 Ent - 1.187 Mean F\n4 < 10 -3 8.2 (84.1) 1.393 Skew + 0.870 Ent - 0.831 Kurt\n5 < 10 -3 6.5 (90.6) 1.142 Skew + 1.001 CV F + 0.733 Q2\n6 < 10 -3 3.2 (93.8) 1.539 Kurt + -1.537 Max F - 1.520 Skew\n7 < 10 -3 2.6 (96.4) -1.304 Mean F + 1.036 Q3 + 0.937 Q1\n8 0.006 1.3 (97.7) -7.824 Mean S + 3.597 Q3 + 2.053 Q2\nThe table shows the loading factors for the 8 significant linear discriminant functions that can be used to classify giggles notes by individual. Since the\ndiscriminant analysis is performed on z-scores and the functions are normalized so that the within-individual variance is 1, the coefficient of the loadings can be\nused to measure the effect of each acoustical parameter. The % variance is the percent of the between-individual variance of means that is explained. The\nnumber in parentheses is the cumulative variance explained.\nMathevon et al. BMC Ecology 2010, 10:9\nhttp://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6785/10/9\nPage 10 of 16In accordance with these previous analyses, the multiple linear regression performed on ‘GrandMeanF’,\n‘SDMeanF’, and ‘GrandMeanS’ showed an influence of\nage on these parameters (see Table 3), and thus confirmed the age-linked lowering of the giggle note mean\nfundamental frequency. From the age of 2 to 20 yearsold, the mean fundamental frequency dropped from 650\nHz to less than 450 Hz (i.e. -30%). The linear regression\nline for that relationship is shown on the right panel of\nfigure 3D (t(15) = -2.93, p = 0.01).\nHormonal treatment\nThe three hormonal treatments were found to result in\ndistinctive giggle notes when the data were analyzed with\nthe MANOVA (P < 10-3; DF(1) = 1.135 CV F + 0.688\nEnt - 0.527 Max F F; DF(2) = 0.925 Max F + 0.823 SD S -\n0.793 CV F) but the pDFA showed that these difference\nwere primarily the result of individual differences. The\npDFA showed that 48% of the notes in the cross-validation set could be classified correctly (versus chance at\n25%) but similar performance or better could be achieved\nwith four random groups 12% of the time. Similar nonconclusive results were found when experimental animals\nare classified along two treatment groups (anti-androgen\nvs anti-estrogen) or lumped into one group (see methods). With two treatment groups the pDFA yielded a\n68% of mean correct assignment versus 55% chance but\np = 0.59. The step-wise linear regression analysis for the\nCVMeanF, CVMeanS, GrandMeanF, SDMeanF, GrandMeanS and SDMeanS showed no effect of treatment\n(Table 3). Therefore, although we cannot exclude the\npossibility that treatment had an effect on the acoustical\nquality of the giggles, if this effect exists it is small and\nwe do not have enough power in our experiment to measure it or it is present in acoustical features not characterized here.\nDominance and Sex\nThe DFA found one significant linear discrimination\nfunction that could be used to classify giggle calls into\ndominant/subordinate groups (P < 10 -3 ; DF(1) = 2.259\nMean S - 1.392 Q2 - 0.956 Q3). All the variables loading\non this function dealt with the distribution with energy\namong the spectrum or, in other words, the spectral\nenvelope. However, the pDFA showed that the successful classification was due to the nested effect of individual differences. Although, the cross-validation data\nshowed that notes could be classified correctly 58% of\nthe time (versus 50% for chance), the random permutations show that the same classification rates would be\nobtained 82% of the time (i.e. P = 0.82) in random\nassignments of individuals to two arbitrary groups (see\nfigure 4A). Thus the results from pDFA did not support\nthe idea that dominance status can be extracted from\nthe acoustical characteristics of single giggles but instead\nshowed that there is enough individual information in\ngiggle notes that particular acoustical dimensions can be\nfound to coarsely separate our 17 hyenas into two arbitrary groups.\nOn the other hand, the analysis of acoustical structure\nacross giggle notes of single individuals showed a robust\neffect for dominance: the linear regression analysis\nshowed that the coefficient of variation of the mean\nspectral frequency (’CVMeanS’) calculated from all giggle notes for each individual was higher (ie. giggle notes\nare more variable) in subordinate animals than in dominant animals and that this effect decreased with age (see\nFigure 4B and Table 3). The ANCOVA post-hoc analysis confirmed that this interaction effect was significant\n(see Table 3). When the data was analysed as 8 dyads\n(and without taking age as a factor), a paired t-test also\nshowed a significant effect for ‘CVMeanS’ (mean\nCVMeanS difference = 0.082, t(7) = 2.387, p = 0.048)\nbut not for any other acoustical measure.\nTable 3 Multiple linear regression results.\nMean F SD F CV F Mean\nS\nSD S CV S\nR2 0.56 0.47 0.40 0.58 0.70 0.71\nF(4,12) 3.87 2.69 2.00 4.19 7.16 7.37\np 0.032 0.082 0.157 0.024 0.0035 0.0031\np-FDR 0.048 0.098 0.157 0.048 0.0105 0.0186\nAge N.

The discriminant functions used to\nseparate individuals support the idea that information\nabout individual identity is primarily encoded by pitch\n(1 st discriminant function) and by the energy\nFigure 4 Dominance information in the giggle note.

The CV is higher in subordinate animals than in dominant animals and decreases with age. The grey lines link the animals that were\nhoused together and form the dyadic dominant/subordinate pairs.\nMathevon et al. BMC Ecology 2010, 10:9\nhttp://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6785/10/9\nPage 12 of 16distribution among the frequency spectrum of giggle\nnotes (2 nd and 3 rd discriminant functions); note duration was also involved (2 nd discriminant function). As\nthe first discriminant function correlated with age, pitch\nwas age-dependent. Following our results, the pitch\naspect of an individual signature is likely to change\nwhen the animal gets older. Besides this, age independent identity and other individual characteristics are\nmainly encoded by the energy distribution among the\nfrequency spectrum. The dominant/subordinate status\nappears to be encoded by variations of the spectrum\nmean frequency within giggles of an individual. The fact\nthat giggle notes are emitted in bouts thus represents a\ncrucial aspect for the potential assessment of this social\ncue. That way, the multiple giggle notes could not only\nprovide redundant information but also additional\n(synergistic) information from the structure created by\nparticular note sequence.\nWe did not find reliable effect of sex even after correcting for the age effect. This result is not universal in\nhyena vocalizations: an analysis of groans by our group\n(in prep.) showed a very clear difference between males\nand females with males showing higher pitch than\nfemales. Giggles might therefore be less sexually\ndimorphic than groans and potentially more influenced\nby other factors. In addition, it is possible that pre-natal\nhormonal treatments also affected sexually dependent\ncharacteristics.\nFrom a methodological point of view, the results from\nthe classical and pDFAs show that while, information\ncoding of age and individual identity within the giggle\nnote are quite robust, any information that we uncovered about gender, dominant/subordinate status or hormonal treatment could be due solely to individual\neffects. Our data set and analyses therefore illustrate the\nimportance of a careful use of DFA statistics of acoustic\nfeatures when searching for vocal signatures, a point\nthat was first stressed by [63].\nIndividual identity coding\nPrevious studies, investigating gregarious mammals’ and\nbirds’ acoustic signals in the context of mate or parentoffspring recognition, have shown that individual identity can be coded by one or several of the following\nsound features: the fundamental frequency (\"pitch”), the\nenergy distribution among the spectrum (\"vocal timbre”), the characteristics of the frequency modulation of\nthe fundamental (e.g., penguins: [65]; gulls: [66]; shearwaters: [67]; marmots: [68]; fur seals: [69,70]). All the\nacoustic signals supporting individual identification are\nusually highly redundant with regards to the coding process and thus resistant to masking effects. For example,\nnon-nested birds use a secured code for long-range propagation of sender’s identity that relies on lower\nharmonics band and frequency modulation of the fundamental. Both cues resist well to propagation-induced\nmodifications such as filtering or scattering by obstacles.\nIn nest-building species where acoustic exchanges occur\nmostly at short range, frequency modulation is almost\nabsent and individual identity is encoded by pitch and\nenergy distribution among the spectrum, the latter being\nhighly sensitive to frequency-filtering during long-range\npropagation [65]. The present analysis showed that giggles encode individuality mostly by these two last cues,\nthe frequency modulation being not primarily involved.\nThis contrasts with another hyena vocalization, the\nwhoop, where individual signature should be encoded\nby the pronounced frequency modulation, as visual\ninspections of spectrograms showed [51]. Thus and in\nspite of instabilities in their frequency spectrum [71],\nwhoops might be more reliable labels of individual identity than giggles over long distances.\nThe reasons for giggling: a puzzling situation\nUp to now, no systematic study has tried to decipher\nthe behavioural context in which giggles are emitted,\nnor their role in the society network. Field researchers\nhave observed that these vocalizations are often produced during food contests, by animals that are prevented from securing access to the kill by the\nintervention of higher ranking individuals. More generally, giggling can occur in non-feeding situations, as the\nresult of simple threat from another individual. Giggles\nhave thus been considered as submissive signals [39,49].\nThe present study was done in captivity and our behavioural observations were certainly biased. Nevertheless,\nwe observed that hyenas were giggling rather as a result\nof frustration (we kept the bone or the piece of meat\nout of their reach) than of harassment or chase.\nAlthough they are emitted during close-range interactions between two or three individuals, giggles are loud\nand propagate over great distances [39](the authors pers.\nobs.). They are thus extremely susceptible to eavesdropping by remote receivers. Giggles may attract other\nspotted hyenas as well as lions Panthera leo, and even\nvultures [39]. During his study in the Ngorongoro (Tanzania), Kruuk [39] noticed that lions often eat prey previously killed by hyenas. Giggles could benefit an\nindividual hyena is different situations. It is known, that\na solitary hyena has no chance when confronted to a\nlion, whereas a hyena group often can “mob” one or\ntwo lions, and maintain or gain access to a carcass [72].\nThus a lone hyena encountering a kill dominated by\nlions could use its giggle call to rally its clan. The attraction of a neighbouring hyena clan or a lion group can\nalso be an issue, as intense competition and giggling\nmay occur over a kill currently mob by the giggling hyena’s clan. In this situation, one can hypothesize that a\nMathevon et al. BMC Ecology 2010, 10:9\nhttp://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6785/10/9\nPage 13 of 16dominant hyena might allow a subordinate hyena access\nto food to prevent it from giggling and attracting further\nattention from unwanted competitors. Or potentially\ngiggling by multiple subordinate animals (giggle chorus)\ncould serve as a distraction for the more dominant animals. However, these hypothetical situations could also\npotentially incur cost for the emitters who risk being\ncompletely deprived of food if the competing clan or\nlion group takes over. Cooperation and competition are\neveryday components of a spotted hyena’s life. When\nhearing a giggling individual, clan-mates hyenas could\nget some information about “who” is currently in a\ncompetitive situation (in terms of individual identity,\nage class, dominant/subordinate status) and decide to\njoin the giggler, or conversely to ignore it or move away.\nOn a larger scale, giggles from a hyena group could\nattract conspecifics, allowing more successful “mobbing”\nof lions. It is also interesting to note that the loud giggle\ncall is absent from the vocal repertoire of the sympatric\nbut less social Brown hyena, Hyaena brunnea [49]. Field\nobservations and playback experiments are needed to\ndetermine the attraction potential of giggles towards\nallies versus intra- and inter-specific competitors, and to\nassess the cost-to-benefit balance of this vocalization.\nThe possibility of monitoring the size and the composition of a feeding group from a distance should also be\ninvestigated to assess if a clan could get information\nabout its neighbours by simply eavesdropping on their\ngiggles. This information could also be of interest to\nresearchers with conservation purposes.\nGiggles and the spotted hyena’s repertoire:\nacoustic tools for a social network\nPrimarily emitted during common confrontations, such\nas those occurring over food, giggles may play an important role in spreading of individual-related information\namong clan-mates. The social organization of a hyena\nclan involves a matrilineal hierarchy. The majority of\nadult males are immigrants and they are “queuing” for\nsocial status, i.e., the most recently arrived male is at the\nbottom of the male hierarchy [46]. Since males depart\nfrom their natal clan and attempt to join a new clan\nwhen mature, the age information embedded in the giggle could be highly informative.\nIn our study, hyenas were housed in dyads (and one\ntriad) where a dominant/subordinate ranking was quickly\nestablished. The giggle was also produced in a conflict\nwith a human which we attribute to have a neutral social\nrank. Although the bi-modal grouping and our experimental protocol allowed us to clearly divide animals into\nsubordinate and dominant, it is a situation which is far\nfrom the hierarchical rank that could be found in wild\nclans of 10 to 90 individuals. It is possible that animals in\nthe “middle” of the rank produce different giggle bouts\nwhen these are directed to higher ranking versus lower\nranking animals. This hypothesis would also imply acoustical structure that is dependent not on morphological\ncharacteristics but on the recognition of social context\nand the possibility of vocal plasticity. This hypothesis\ncould be tested both in the field and in our captive colony by housing animals in larger groups.\nThe vocal repertoire of spotted hyenas is very large\nand most of the calls should play a role in the regulation\nof the social network. Status signalling is almost certainly not restricted to giggles. The whoop is used to\ntransfer information to remote congeners and may allow\nindividual identification of the sender as well as its current emotional state over distances up to 5 km\n[51,53,73,74]. Not only are whoop calls highly idiosyncratic making but it is also known that mothers will\nrespond to the whoop from their own cub more frequently than to the whoop of a non-kin cub, demonstrating that the individual characteristics in the whoop\nsounds are recognized and utilized [73]. It is likely that\nclose-range vocalizations like the grunt, groan and\ngrowl, are also multi-informative [[39], Page et al. in\nprep.]. The use of both ‘public’ and ‘private’ signalling\n[75,76], would enable hyenas to manage their social\ninteractions with great precision. In this context, giggles\nmight play a dual role, addressed to both nearby clanmates and remote potential allies.\nConclusions\nSpotted hyenas demonstrate high cognitive skills, like\ntheir ability to recognize third-party relationships [77], a\ncharacteristic that has been found in a restricted number of animals (e.g., primates [78]; birds [79]). Their\nsubstantial vocal repertoire should play a very important\nrole, by providing eavesdroppers with a number of\nimportant cues about the emitters’ identity and characteristics. As the present study showed, the giggle is likely\nto carry a broad range of messages, certainly not all perfectly reliable, but sufficiently informative to play a role\nduring social interactions. Information carried by vocalizations, together with chemical, tactile and visual channels [48,80], ensure to the spotted hyena an array of\ncommunication signals which underlie its complex\nsocial system. More research, with a particular emphasis\non experimental studies with playback - or involving\nmanipulations -, is needed to specifically determine\nwhether the information bearing structure in giggle\nsounds described here is actually used by the spotted\nhyena and, more generally, to decipher the complex\ncommunication network of this species. Comparing the\nspotted hyena’s communication system with the one of\nother, less social, Hyaenids [81] would also be of great\ninterest and facilitate understanding of the relationships\nbetween sociality and animal signals.\nMathevon et al.

There are striking behavioural, neural and genetic similarities between auditory-vocal learning in birds and human infants. Recently,\nthe linguistic parallels between birdsong and spoken\nlanguage have begun to be investigated. Although both\nbirdsong and human language are hierarchically organized according to particular syntactic constraints, birdsong structure is best characterized as ‘phonological\nsyntax’, resembling aspects of human sound structure.\nCrucially, birdsong lacks semantics and words. Formal\nlanguage and linguistic analysis remains essential for\nthe proper characterization of birdsong as a model system for human speech and language, and for the study of\nthe brain and cognition evolution.\nHuman language and birdsong: the biological\nperspective\nDarwin [1] noted strong similarities between the ways that\nhuman infants learn to speak and birds learn to sing. This\n‘perspective from organismal biology’ [2] initially led to a\nfocus on apes as model systems for human speech and\nlanguage (see Glossary), with limited success, however\n[3,4]. Since the end of the 20th century, biologists and\nlinguists have shown a renewed interest in songbirds,\nrevealing fascinating similarities between birdsong and\nhuman speech at the behavioural, neural, genomic and\ncognitive levels [5–9]. Yip has reviewed the relationship\nbetween human phonology and birdsong [7]. Here, we\naddress another potential parallel between birdsong and\nhuman language: syntax.\nComparing syntactic ability across birds and humans is\nimportant, because at least since the beginning of the\nmodern era in cognitive science and linguistics, a combinatorial syntax has been viewed to lie at the heart of the\ndistinctive creative and open-ended nature of human language [10]. Here, we discuss current understanding of the\nrelationship between birdsong and human syntax in light\nof recent experimental and linguistic advances, focusing on\nthe formal parallels and their implications for underlying\ncognitive and computational abilities. Finally, we sketch\nthe prospects for future experimental work, as part of the\nReview\nGlossary\nBigram: a subsequence of two elements (notes, words or phrases) in a string.\nContext-free language (CFL): the sets of strings that can be recognized or\ngenerated by a pushdown-stack automaton or context-free grammar. A CFL\nmight have grammatical dependencies nested inside to any depth, but\ndependencies cannot overlap.\nFinite-state automaton (FSA, FA): a computational model of a machine with\nfinite memory, consisting of a finite set of states, a start state, an input\nalphabet, and a transition function that maps input symbols and current states\nto some set of next states.\nFinite-state grammar (FSG): a grammar that formally replicates the structure of\na FSA, also generating the regular languages.\nK-reversible finite-state automaton: an FSA that is deterministic when one\n‘reverses’ all the transitions so that the automaton runs backwards. One can\n‘look behind’ k previous words to resolve any possible ambiguity about which\nnext state to move to.\nLanguage: any possible set of strings over some (usually finite) alphabet of\nwords.\nLocally testable language: a strict subset of the regular languages formed by\nthe union, intersection, or complement of strictly locally testable languages.\n(First-order) Markov model or process: a random process where the next state\nof a system depends only on the current state and not its previous states.\nApplied to word or acoustic sequences, the next word or acoustic unit in the\nsequence depends only on the current word or acoustic unit, rather than\nprevious words or units.\nMildly context-sensitive language (MCSL): a language family that lies ‘just\nbeyond’ the CFLs in terms of power, and thought to encompass all the known\nhuman languages. A MCSL is distinguished from a CFL in that it contains\nclauses that can be nested inside clauses arbitrarily deeply, with a limited\nnumber of overlapping grammatical dependencies.\nMorphology: the possible ‘word shapes’ in a language; that is, the syntax of\nwords and word parts.\nPhoneme: the smallest possible meaningful unit of sound.\nPhonetics: the study of the actual speech sounds of all languages, including\ntheir physical properties, the way they are perceived and the way in which\nvocal organs produce sounds.\nPhonology: the study of the abstract sound patterns of a particular language,\nusually according to some system of rules.\nPush-down stack automaton (PDA): a FSA augmented with a potentially\nunbounded memory store, a push-down stack, that can be accessed in terms of\na last-in, first-out basis, similar to a stack of dinner plates, with the last element\nplaced on the stack being the top of the stack, and first accessible memory\nelement. PDAs recognize the class of CFLs.\nRecursion: a property of a (set of) grammar rules such that a phrase A can\neventually be rewritten as itself with non-empty strings of words or phrase\nnames on either side in the form aAb and where A derives one or more words\nin the language.\nRegular language: a language recognized or generated by a FSA or a FSG.\nSemantics: the analysis of the meaning of a language, at the word, phrase,\nsentence level, or beyond.\nStrictly locally testable language (or stringset): a strict subset of the regular\nlanguages defined in terms of a finite list of strings of length less than or equal\nto some upper length k (the ‘window length’).\nSub-regular language: any subset of the regular languages, in particular\ngenerally a strict subset with some property of interest, such as local testability.\nSyllable: in linguistics, a vowel plus one or more preceding or following\nconsonants.\nSyntax: the rules for arranging items (sounds, words, word parts or phrases)\ninto their possible permissible combinations in a language.\nCorresponding author: Bolhuis, J.J.

We show that, although it has a simple\nsyntactic structure, birdsong cannot be directly compared\nwith the syntactic complexity of human language, principally because it has neither semantics nor a lexicon.\nComparing human language and birdsong\nHuman speech and birdsong both consist of complex, patterned vocalizations (Figure 1). Such sequential structures\ncan be analysed and compared via formal syntactic methods.\nAristotle described language as sound paired with meaning\n[12]. Although partly accurate, a proper interspecies comparison calls for a more articulated ‘system diagram’ of the\nkey components of human language, and their non-human\ncounterparts. We depict these as a tripartite division\n(Figure 2): (i) an ‘external interface’, a sensorimotor-driven,\ninput–output system providing proper articulatory output\nand perceptual analysis; (ii) a rule system generating correctly structured sentence forms, incorporating words; and\n(iii) an ‘internal interface’ to a conceptual–intentional system of meaning and reasoning; that is, ‘semantics’. Component (i) corresponds to systems for producing, perceiving and\nlearning acoustic sequences, and might itself involve abstract representations that are not strictly sensorimotor,\nsuch as stress placement. In current linguistic frameworks,\n(i) aligns with acoustic phonetics and phonology, for both\nproduction and perception. Component (ii) feeds into both\nthe sensorimotor interface (i), as well as a conceptual–intentional system (iii), and is usually described via some\nmodel of recursive syntax.\nAlthough linguists debate the details of these components, there seems to be more general agreement as to the\nnature of (i), less agreement as to the nature of (ii) and\nwidespread controversy as to (iii). For instance, whereas\nthe connection between a fully recursive syntax and a\nconceptual–intentional system is sometimes considered\nto lie at the heart of the species-specific properties of\nhuman language, there is considerable debate over the\ndetails, which plays out as the distinct variants of current\nlinguistic theories [13–16]. Some of these accounts reduce\nor even eliminate the role of (ii), assuming a more direct\nrelation between (i) and (iii) (e.g. [17,18]). The system\ndiagram in Figure 2 therefore cannot represent any detailed neuroanatomical or abstract ‘wiring diagram’, but\n[\n(\n)\nT\nD\n$\nF\nI\nG\n]\n0.5 s\nFrequency (kHz)\n0\n10 iii\nNote\nSyllable\nMotif\nTRENDS in Cognitive Sciences\nFigure 1.

A tripartite diagram of abstract components encompassing both human language and birdsong. On the left-hand side, an external interface (i), comprised of\nsensorimotor systems, links the perception and production of acoustic signals to an internal system of syntactic rules, (ii). On the right-hand side, an internal interface links\nsyntactic forms to some system of concepts and intentions, (iii). With respect to this decomposition, birdsong seems distinct from human language in the sense of lacking\nboth words and a fully developed conceptual–intentional system.\nReview Trends in Cognitive Sciences March 2011, Vol. 15, No. 3\n114rather a way to factor apart the distinct knowledge types in\nthe sense of Marr [19]. Notably, our tripartite arrangement\ndoes not preclude the possibility that only humans have\nsyntactic rules, or that such rules always fix information\ncontent in a language-like manner. For example, in songbirds, sequential syntactic rules might exist only to construct variable song element sequences rather than\nvariable meanings per se [9].\nBirdsong and human syntax: similarities and differences\nBoth birdsong and human language are hierarchically\norganized according to syntactic constraints. We compare\nthem by first considering the complexity of their sound\nstructure, and then turning in the next section, to aspects\nbeyond this dimension. Overall, we find that birdsong\nsound structure, at least for the Bengalese finch, seems\ncharacterizable by an easily learnable, highly restricted\nsubclass of the regular languages (languages that can be\nrecognized or generated by finite-state machines; see Box\n3). Whereas human language sound structure also appears\nto be describable via finite-state machines, comparable\nresults are lacking in the case of human language, although certain parts of human language sound structure,\nsuch as stress patterns, have also recently been shown to\nbe easily learnable [20].\nIn birdsong, individual notes can be combined as particular sequences into syllables, syllables into ‘motifs’, and\nmotifs into complete song ‘bouts’ (Figure 1). Birdsong thus\nconsists of chains of discrete acoustic elements arranged in\na particular temporal order [21–23]. Songs might consist of\nfixed sequences with only sporadic variation (e.g. zebra\nfinches), or more variable sequences (e.g. nightingales,\nstarlings, or Bengalese finches), where a song element\nmight be followed by several alternatives, with overall\nsong structure describable by probabilistic rules between\na finite number of states [23,24] (Figure I, Box 1). For\nexample, a song of a nightingale is built out of a fixed 4second note sequence. An individual nightingale has 100–\n200 song types, clustered into 2–12 ‘packages’. Package\nsinging order remains probabilistic [25]. A starling song\nbout might last up to 1 minute, composed of many distinct\nmotifs containing song elements in a fixed order lasting\n0.5–1.5 seconds. Gentner and Hulse [26] found that a firstorder Markov model (i.e. bigrams) suffices to describe most\nmotif sequence information in starling songs (Box 2). Thus,\nfor the most part, the next motif is predictable by the\nimmediately preceding motif. Starlings also use this information to recognize specific song bouts. Similarly, in American thrush species, relatively low-order Markov chains\nsuffice for modelling song sequence variability [27].\nCan songbird ‘phonological syntax’ [28] ever be more\ncomplex than this? Bengalese finch song typically contains\napproximately eight song note types organized into 2–5\nnote ‘chunks’ that also follow local transition probabilities\n[29] (Figure I, Box 1). Unlike single-note Markov processes,\nchunks such as the three-note sequence cde can be reused\nin other places in a song [24,30]. However, chunks are not\nreused inside other chunks, so the hierarchical depth is\nstrictly limited.\nIf Bengalese finch song could be characterized solely in\nterms of bigrams, it would belong to the class of so-called\n‘strictly locally 2-testable languages’, a highly restricted\nsubset of the class of the regular languages, That is, a bird\ncould verify, either for purposes of production or for recognition, whether a song is properly formed by simply ‘sliding’ a set of two-note sequences or ‘window constraints’\nacross the entire note sequence, checking to see that all the\ntwo-note sequences found ‘pass’ (Box 3). For example, if the\nvalid note sequences were ab, abab, ababab, and so on,\nthen every a must be followed by a b, except at the song\nstart; and every b must be followed by an a, except at the\nsong end. Thus, aside from the beginning and end of a song,\na bird could check whether a song is well formed by using\ntwo bigram templates: [a-b] and [b-a]. This turns out to be\nthe simplest kind of pattern recognizable by a finite-state\nautomaton (FSA), because the internal states of the automaton need not be used for any detailed computation\naside from bigram note template matching (Box 3).\nThe Bengalese finch song automaton in Figure I (Box 1),\nwhich encompasses the full song sequence repertoire\nextracted from a single, actual bird [31], indicates that\nbirdsong structure can be more complicated than a simple\nBox 1. Birdsong, human language syntax and the Chomsky hierarchy\nAll sets of strings, or languages, can be rank ordered via strict setinclusion according to their computational power. The resulting\n‘rings’ are called the ‘Chomsky hierarchy’ [61] (Figure I; ring\nnumbers are used below). For birdsong and human syntax\ncomparisons, the most important point is the small overlap between\nthe possible languages generated by human syntax (the irregularshaded grey set), as opposed to birdsong syntax (the stippled\ngrey set).\n1. The finite languages, all sets of strings of finite length.\n2. The FSA generating the regular languages. An FSA is represented\nas a directed graph of states with labelled edges, a finite-state\ntransition network. The corresponding grammar of an FSA has\nrules of the form X!aY or X!a, or right-linear, where X and Y\nrange over possible automaton states (nonterminals), and a ranges\nover symbols corresponding to the labelled transitions between\nstates. The FSA recognizing the (ab) 1 language only need to test for\nfour specific adjacent string symbol pairs (bigrams; the pairs (leftedge, a); (a,b); (b, a); and (b, right-edge) [62].\n3. The PDA, generating the CFLs. PDAs are finite-state machines\naugmented with a potentially unbounded auxiliary memory that\ncan be accessed from the top working down. PDAs can be thought\nof as augmenting FSA with the ability to use subroutines, yielding\nthe recursive transition networks. Grammars for these languages\nare consequently more general and can include rules such as\nX!Ya, X!aYa or X!aXa, or context-free rules.\n4. The PDA whose stacks might themselves be augmented with\nembedded stacks, generating the MCSLs. Examples of such\npatterns in human languages are rare, but do exist [63,64]. These\npatterns are exemplified by stringsets such as a n\nb m\nc n\nd m, where the\nas and cs must match up in number and order and, separately, the\nbs and the cs, so-called ‘cross-serial’ dependencies (see [65,66]). A\nbroad range of linguistic theories accommodate this much\ncomplexity [13–16,59,66]. No known human languages require\nmore power than this. The two irregular sets drawn cutting across\nthe hierarchy depict the probable location of the human languages\n(shaded) and birdsong (stippled). Both clearly do not completely\nsubsume any of the previously mentioned stringsets. Birdsong and\nhuman languages intersect at the very bottom owing to the\npossible overlap of finite lists of human words and the vocal\nrepertoire of certain birds.\nReview Trends in Cognitive Sciences March 2011, Vol. 15, No. 3\n115[()TD$FIG]0 1 2 3\nTRENDS in Cognitive Sciences\na1 a2 b 2 b1\n2 Regular languages\nBengalese finch song\n3 Context-free languages\na nb n\n4 Mildly context-sensitive\nlanguages\na nb ncnd n\nJon Mary Peter Jane lets help teach swim\n5 Context-sensitive languages\na nbncn dnen\n6 Recursively enumerable\nlanguages\na 1 a2 a3 b 1 b 2 b3a4 b 4\nthe starling the cats want was tired\nHuman languages\nBirdsong\n?\nfg\nab\nab\ncdeab\n1 Finite\nlanguages\nFigure I. The Chomsky hierarchy of languages along with the hypothesized locations of both human language and birdsong. The nested rings in the figure correspond\nto the increasingly larger sets, or languages, generated or recognized by more powerful automata or grammars. An example of the state transition diagram\ncorresponding to a typical Bengalese finch song [31] is shown in the next ring after this, corresponding to some subset of the regular languages.\nReview Trends in Cognitive Sciences March 2011, Vol. 15, No. 3\n116bigram description. Although there are several paths\nthrough this network from the beginning state on the left\nto the double-circled end state on the right, the ‘loop’ back\nfrom state 2 to state 1 along with the loop from state 3 to 1\ncan generate songs with an arbitrary number of cde ab\nnotes, followed by the notes cde fg. From there, a song can\ncontinue with the notes ab back to state 1, and so lead to\nanother arbitrary number of cde ab notes, all finally ending\nin cde fg. In fact, the transitions between states are stochastic; that is, the finch can vary its song by choosing to go\nfrom state 2 back to state 1 with some likelihood that is\nmeasurably different from the likelihood of continuing on\nto state 3. In any case, formally this means that the notes\ncde fg can appear in the ‘middle’ of a song, arbitrarily far\nfrom either end, bracketed on both sides by some arbitrarily long number of cde ab repetitions. Such a note pattern is\nno longer strictly locally testable because now there can be\nno fixed-length ‘window’ that can check whether a note\nsequence ‘passes’. Instead of checking the note sequences\ndirectly, one must use the memory of the FSA indirectly to\n‘wait’ after encountering the first of a possibly arbitrarily\nlong sequence of cde abs. The automaton must then stay in\nthis state until the required cde fg sequence appears. Such\na language pattern remains recognizable by a restricted\nFSA, but one more powerful than a simple bigram checking\nmachine. Such complexity seems typical. Figure 3 displays\nmore fully a second, more complex Bengalese finch song\ndrawn according to the same transition network methodology, this time explicitly showing the probability that one\nstate follows another via the numbers on the links between\nBox 2. Is recursion for the birds?\nRecursive constructs occur in many familiar human language examples, such as the starling the cats want was tired, where one finds a full\nsentence phrase, the starling was tired, that contains within it a second,\n‘nested’ or ‘self-embedded’ sentence, S, the cats want. In this case, the\nrule that constructs Sentences can apply to its own output, recursively\ngenerating a pattern of ‘nested’ or ‘serial’ dependencies.\nWe can write a simple CFG with three rules that illustrates this\nconcept as follows: S!aB; B!Sb; S!e, where e corresponds to the\nempty symbol. We can use this grammar to show that one can first\napply the rule that expands S as aB and then can apply the second rule\nto expand B as Sb, thus obtaining, aSb; S now appears with non-null\nelements on both sides, so we say that S has been ‘self-embedded’. If\nwe now use the third rule to replace S with the empty symbol, we\nobtain the output ab. Alternatively, we could apply the first and second\nrules over again to obtain the string aabb, or, more generally, an\nbn for\nany integer n.\nIn our example, the as and the bs in fact form nested\ndependencies because they are correspondingly paired in the same\nway that the starling must be paired with the singular form was,\nrather than the plural were; similarly, the cats must be paired with\nwant rather than the singular form wants. So, for example, to\nindicate a nested dependency pattern properly, the form a 3 b3\nshould be more accurately written as a1a2a3b3b2b1 , where the\nsuperscripts indicate which as and bs must be paired up. Thus, any\nmethod to detect whether an animal can either recognize or produce\na strictly context-free pattern requires that one demonstrates that\nthe correct as and bs are paired up; merely recognizing that the\nnumber of as matches the number of bs does not suffice. This is one\nkey difficulty with the Gentner et al. protocol and result [56], which\nprobed only for the ability of starlings to recognize an equal number\nof as and bs in terms of warble and rattle sound classes (i.e.\nwarlble 3 rattle 3 patterns) but did not test for whether these warblerattles were properly paired off in a nested dependency fashion. As\na result, considerable controversy remains as to whether any nonhuman species can truly recognize strictly context-free patterns\n[11,67].\nBox 3. Descriptive complexity, birdsong and human syntax\nThe substructure of the regular languages, sub-regular language\nhierarchies, could be relevant to gain insight into the computational\ncapacities of animals and humans in the domain of acoustic and\nartificial language learning [62,68,69]. Similar to the Chomsky\nhierarchy, the family of regular languages can itself be ordered in\nterms of strictly inclusive sets of increasing complexity [69]. The\nordering uses the notion of descriptive complexity, corresponding\ninformally to how much local context and internal state information\nmust be used by a finite-state machine to recognize a particular string\npattern correctly. For example, to recognize the regular pattern used\nin the starling experiment [56], (ab) 1\n, a finite-state machine needs only\nto check four adjacency relations or bigrams as they appear directly in\na candidate string: the beginning of the string followed by an a; an a\nfollowed by a b;, a b followed by an a or else a b followed by the end\nof the string. We can say such a pattern is strictly locally 2-testable or\nSL 2 [69]. As we increase the length of these factors, we obtain a\nstrictly increasing set hierarchy of regular languages, the strictly\nlocally testable languages, denoted SL k, where k is the ‘window\nlength’ [56,62,68]. It might be of some value to understand the range\nof sub-regular patterns that birds can perceive or produce. To\ntentatively answer this question, we applied a program for computing\nlocal testability [38,44,70]. For example, the FSA in Figure I (Box 1)\nrecognizes a language that is locally testable. This answer agrees with\nthe independent findings of Okanoya [31] and Gentner [26,57].\nOther sub-regular pattern families have been recently explored in\nconnection with human language sound systems [20,71]. Some of these\nmight ultimately prove relevant to birdsong because they deal with\nacoustic patterns. In particular, possible sound combinations might fall\ninto the same classes as those of human languages. Finally, all these\nsub-regular families could be extended straightforwardly to include\nphrases explicitly, but still without the ability to ‘count’, as seems true\nof human language ([66,72–74] R. Berwick, PhD Thesis, MIT, 1982). It is\nclear that we have only just begun to scratch the surface of the detailed\nstructure of sub-regular patterns and their cognitive relevance.\n[\n(\n)\nT\nD\n$\nF\nI\nG\n]\naaa b bcadb\nhh\nhh\n0.08\n0.12 b\nilga\n0.37\nadb\n0.33\neekfff\n0.88\nbhh\n0.22\nf\n0.44\njaa\nlga\n0.55\nTRENDS in Cognitive Sciences\nFigure 3. Probabilistic finite-state transition diagram of the song repertoire of a\nBengalese finch. Directed transition links between states are labelled with note\nsequences along with the probability of moving along that particular link and\nproducing the associated note sequence. The possibility of loops on either side of\nfixed note sequences such as hh or lga mean that this song is not strictly locally\ntestable (see Box 3 and main text). However, it is still k-reversible, and so easily\nlearned from example songs [35]. Adapted, with permission, from [75].\nReview Trends in Cognitive Sciences March 2011, Vol. 15, No. 3\n117states [32]. It too contains loops, including one from the\nfinal, double-circled state back to the start, so that a certain\nsong portion can be found located arbitrarily far in the\nmiddle. For example, among several other possibilities, the\nnote sequence lga, which occurs on the transition to the\ndouble-circled final state, can be preceded by any number\nof b hh repetitions, as well as followed by jaa b bcadb and\nthen an arbitrary number of eekfff adb notes, again via a\nloop.\nNightingales, another species with complex songs, can\nsing motifs with notes that are similarly embedded within\nlooped note chunks [33]. Considering that there are hundreds of such motifs in a song repertoire of a nightingale,\ntheir songs must be at least as complex as those of Bengalese finches, at least from this formal standpoint.\nMore precisely and importantly, the languages involved\nhere, at least in the case of Bengalese finch, and perhaps\nother avian species, are closely related to constraints on\nregular languages that enable them to be easily learned\n[31,34,35]. Kakishita et al. [29] constructed a particular\nkind of restricted FSA generating the observed sequences\n(a k-reversible FSA). Intuitively, in this restricted case, a\nlearner can determine whether two states are equivalent\nby examining only the local note sequences that can follow\nfrom any two states, determining whether the two states\nshould be considered equivalent [36,37] (Figure I, Box 1). It\nis this local property that enables a learner to learn correctly and efficiently the proper automaton corresponding\nto external song sequences simply by listening to them,\nsomething that is impossible in general for FSA [38,39].\nWhat about human language sound structure or its\nphonology? This is also now known to be describable purely\nin terms of FSA [40], a result that was not anticipated by\nearlier work in the field [41] which assumed more general\ncomputational devices well beyond the power of FSA (Box\n1). For example, there are familiar ‘phonotactic’ constraints in every language, such that English speakers\nknow that a form such as ptak could not be a possible\nEnglish word, but plast might be [42]. To be sure, such\nconstraints are often not ‘all or none’ but might depend on\nthe statistical frequency of word subparts. Such gradation\nmight also be present in birdsong, as reflected by the\nprobabilistic transitions between states, as shown in Figure I (Box 1) and Figure 3 [31,43]. Once stochastic gradation is modelled, phonotactic constraints more closely\nmirror those found in birdsong finite-state descriptions.\nSuch formal findings have been buttressed by recent\nexperiments with both human infants and Bengalese\nfinches, confirming that adjacent acoustic dependencies\nof this sort are readily learnable from an early age using\nstatistical and prosodic cues [32,44–46].\nHowever, other human sound structure rules apparently go beyond this simplest kind of strictly local description,\nalthough remaining finite state. These include the rules\nthat account for ‘vowel harmony’ in languages such as\nTurkish, where, for example, the properties of the vowel\nu in the word pul, ‘stamp’, are ‘propagated’ through to all\nits endings [7], and stress patterns (J. Heinz, PhD thesis,\nUniversity of California at Los Angeles, 2007). Whereas\nthe limited-depth hierarchies that arise in songbird syntax\nseem reminiscent of the bounded rhythmic structures or\n‘beat patterns’ found in human speech or music, it remains\nan open question whether birdsong metrical structure is\namenable to the formal analysis of musical meter, or even\nhow stress is perceived in birds as opposed to humans [47–\n49] (Box 4).\nTweets to phrases: the role of words\nTurning to syntactic description that lies beyond sound\nstructure, we find that birdsong and human language\nsyntax sharply diverge. In human syntax, but not birdsong,\nhierarchical combinations of effectively arbitrary depth\ncan be assembled by combining words and words parts,\nsuch as the addition of s to the end of apple to yield apples, a\nword-construction process called ‘morphology’. Human\nsyntax then goes even further, organizing words into\nhigher-order phrases and entire sentences. None of these\nadditional levels appear to be found in birdsong. This\nreinforces Marler’s long-standing view [28] that birdsong\nmight best be regarded as ‘phonological syntax’, a formal\nlanguage; that is, a set of units (here acoustic elements)\nthat are arranged in particular ways but not others according to a definable rule set.\nWhat accounts for this difference between birdsong and\nlanguage? First, birdsong lacks semantics and words in the\nhuman sense, because song elements are not combined to\nyield novel ‘meanings’. Instead, birdsong can convey only a\nlimited set of intentions, as a graded, holistic communication system to attract mates or deter rivals and defend\nterritory. In terms of the tripartite diagram of Figure 2, the\nconceptual–intentional component is greatly reduced.\nBirds might still have some internalized conceptual–intentional system, but for whatever reason it is not connected to\na syntactic and externalization component. By contrast,\nhuman syntax is intimately wedded to our conceptual\nsystem, involving words in both their syntactic and semantic aspects, so that, for example, combining ‘red’ with\n‘apples’ yields a meaning quite distinct from, for example,\n‘green apples’. It seems plausible that this single distinction drives fundamental differences between birdsong and\nhuman syntax. In particular, birds such as Bengalese\nfinches and nightingales can and do vary their songs in\nthe acoustic domain, rearranging existing ‘chunks’ to produce hundreds of distinct song types that might serve to\nidentify individual birds and their degree of sexual arousal,\nas well as local ‘dialect-based’ congener groups [50–52],\nalthough a recent systematic study of song recombination\nsuggests that birds rarely introduce improvised song notes\nor sequences [32]. For example, skylarks mark individual\nidentity by particular song notes [51], as starlings do with\nsong sequences [52]; and canaries use special ‘sexy syllables’ to strengthen the effect of mate attraction [50]. However, more importantly, this bounded acoustic creativity\npales in comparison with the seemingly limitless openended variation observed in even a single human speaker,\nwhere variation might be found not only at the acoustic\nlevel in how a word is spoken, but also in how words are\ncombined into larger structures with distinct meanings,\nwhat could be called ‘compositional creativity’. It is this\nlatter aspect that appears absent in birdsong. Song variants do not result in distinct ‘meanings’ with completely\nnew semantics, but serve only to modify the entirety of the\nReview Trends in Cognitive Sciences March 2011, Vol. 15, No. 3\n118original behavioural function of the song within the context\nof mating, never producing a new behavioural context, and\nso remaining part of a graded communication system. For\nexample, the ‘sexy syllable’ conveys the strength of the\nmotivation of a canary, but does not change the meaning of\nits song [50]. In this sense, birdsong creativity lies along a\nfinite, acoustic combinational dimension, never at the level\nof human compositional creativity.\nSecond, unlike birdsong, human language sentences are\npotentially unbounded in length and structure, limited only\nby extraneous factors, such as short-term memory or lung\ncapacity [53]. Here too words are important. The combination of the Verb ate and the Noun apples yields the combination ate apples that has the properties of a Verb rather\nthan a Noun. This effectively ‘names’ the combination as a\nnew piece of hierarchical structure, phrase, with the label\nate, dubbed the head of the phrase [54]. This new Verb-like\ncombination can then act as a single object and enter into\nfurther syntactic combinations. For example, Allison and ate\napples can combine to form Allison ate apples, again taking\nate as the head. Phrases can recombine ad infinitum to form\never-longer sentences, so exhibiting the open-ended novelty\nthat von Humboldt famously called ‘the infinite use of finite\nmeans’ [55], that is immediately recognized as the hallmark\nof human language: Pat recalled that Charlie said that\nMoira thought that Allison ate apples. Thus in general,\nsentences can be embedded within other sentences, recursively, as in the starling the cats want was tired, in a ‘nested’\ndependency pattern, where we find one ‘top-level’ sentence,\nthe starling was tired, consisting of a Subject, the starling,\nand a Predicate phrase was tired, that in turn itself contains\na Sentence, the cats want formed out of another Subject, the\ncats, and a Predicate, want. Informally, we call such embeddings ‘recursive’, and the resulting languages ‘context-free\nlanguages’ (CFLs; Box 1). This pattern reveals a characteristic possibility for human language, a ‘nested dependency’.\nThe singular number feature associated with the Subject,\nthe starling, must match up with the singular number\nfeature associated with top-level Verb form was, whereas\nthe embedded sentence, the cats want has a plural Subject,\nthe cats, that must agree with the plural Verb form want.\nSuch ‘serial nested dependencies’ in the abstract form,\na1\na2\nb2\nb1 are both produced and recognized quite generally\nin human language [53].\nThe evidence for a corresponding ability in birds\nremains weak, despite recent experiments on training\nstarlings to recognize such patterns (which must be carefully distinguished from the ability to produce such\nsequences in a naturalistic setting, as described in the\nprevious section) [56,57]. In starlings, only the ability to\nrecognize nesting was tested, and not the crucial dependency aspect that pairs up particular as with particular bs\n[11] (Box 2). In fact, human syntax goes beyond this kind of\nrecursion to encompass certain strictly mildly contextsensitive constructions that have even more complex, overlapping dependency patterns (Box 1). Importantly, even\nthough they differ on much else, since approximately 1970\na broad range of syntactic theories, comprising most of the\nmajor strands of modern linguistic thought, have incorporated Bloomfield’s [54] central insight that human language syntax is combinatorially word-centric in the\nmanner described above [13–16,58,59], as well as having\nthe power to describe both nested and overlapped dependencies. To our knowledge, such mild-context sensitivity\nhas never been demonstrated, or even tested, in any nonhuman species.\nIn short, word-driven structure building seems totally\nabsent in songbird syntax, and this limits its potential\nhierarchical complexity. Birdsong motifs lack word-centric\n‘heads’ and so cannot be individuated via some internal\nlabelling mechanism to participate in the construction of\narbitrary-depth structures. Whereas a starling song might\nconsist of a sequence of warbles and rattle motif classes\n[57], there seems to be no corresponding way in which the\nacoustical features of the warble class are then used to\n‘name’ distinctively the warble-rattle sequence as a whole,\nso that this combination can then be manipulated as single\nunit phrases into ever-more complex syntactic structures.\nBirdsong phrase structure?\nNonetheless, recent findings suggest that birds have a\nlimited ability to construct phrases, at least in the acoustic\ndomain, as noted above, accounting for individual variation within species [32,33]. In particular, there might be\nacoustic segmentation chunking in the self-produced song\nof the Bengalese finch [29,31]. Suge and Okanoya used the\n‘click’ protocol pioneered by Fodor et al. [60] to probe the\n‘psychological reality’ of syntactic phrases in humans [34].\nBox 4. Questions for future research\n\u000f We do not know for certain the descriptive complexity of birdsong.\nDoes it belong to any particular member of the sub-regular\nlanguage hierarchies, or does it lie outside these, possibly in the\nfamily of strictly CFLs? If birdsong is contained in some sub-regular\nhierarchy, how is this result to be reconciled with the findings in the\nGentner et al. starling study [56]? If birdsong is context free, then\nwe can again ask to what family of CFLs it belongs: is it a\ndeterministic CFL (as opposed to a general CFL)? Is it learnable from\npositive examples?\n\u000f Current tests of finite-state versus CFL abilities in birdsong have\nchosen only the weakest (computationally and descriptively\nsimplest) finite-state language to compare against the simplest\nCFL. Can starlings be trained to recognize descriptively more\ncomplex finite-state patterns; for example, a locally testable but\nnot non-strictly local testable finite-state pattern, such as a1 (ba1\n) 1\n,\nwhere a bird would have to recognize a note(s) such as b arbitrarily\nfar from both ends of a song [68]? What about sub-regular patterns\nthat are more complicated than this?\n\u000f The Gentner et al. experiment [49] did not test for the nested\ndependency structure characteristic of embedded sentences in\nhuman language. Can birds be trained to recognize truly nested\ndependencies, even if just of finite depth?\n\u000f Using the methods developed in, for example, [71], what is the\ndescriptive complexity of prosody or rhythmic stress patterns in\nbirdsong?\n\u000f What are the neural mechanisms underlying variable song\nsequences in songbirds? Both human speech and birdsong involve\nsequentially arranged vocalizations. Are there similar neural\nmechanisms for the production and perception of such sequences\nin songbirds and humans? Bolhuis et al. [9] have summarized\ncurrent knowledge of these mechanisms in humans and birds.\nReview Trends in Cognitive Sciences March 2011, Vol. 15, No. 3\n119Applied to human language, subjects given ‘click’ stimuli in\nthe middle of phrases such as ate the apples, tend to\n‘migrate’ their perception of where the click occurs to the\nbeginning or end of the phrase. Suge and Okanoya established that 3-4 note sequences, such as the cde in Figure I\n(Box 1) are perceived as unitary ‘chunks’ so that the finches\ntended to respond as if the click was at the c or e end of an\ncde ‘chunk [34]. Importantly, recall that Bengalese finches\nare also able to produce such sequence chunks, as described earlier and in Figure I (Box 1) and Figure 3. This\nis strikingly similar to the human syntactic capacity to\n‘remember’ an entire sequence encapsulated as a single\nphrase or a ‘state’ of an automaton, and to reuse that\nencapsulation elsewhere, just as human syntax reuses\nNoun Phrases and Verb Phrases. However, Bengalese\nfinches do not seem to be able to manipulate chunks with\nthe full flexibility of dependent nesting found in human\nsyntax. One might speculate that, with the addition of\nwords, humans acquired the ability to label and ‘hold in\nmemory’ in separate locations distinct phrases such as\nAllison ate apples and Moira thought otherwise, parallel\nto the ability to label and separately store in memory the\nwords ate and thought. Once words infiltrated the basic\npre-existing syntactic machinery, the combinatory possibilities became open ended.\nConclusions and perspectives\nDespite considerable linguistic interest in birdsong, few\nstudies have applied formal syntactic methods to its structure. Those that do exist suggest that birdsong syntax lies\nwell beyond the power of bigram descriptions, but is at\nmost only as powerful as k-reversible regular languages,\nlacking the nested dependencies that are characteristic of\nhuman syntax [11,29,56,57]. This is probably because of\nthe lack of semantics in birdsong, because song sequence\nchanges typically alter message strength but not message\ntype. This would imply that birdsong might best serve as\nan animal model to study learning and neural control of\nhuman speech [9], rather than internal syntax or semantics per se. Furthermore, comparing the structure of human speech and birdsong can be a useful tool for the study\nof the evolution of brain and behaviour (Box 4). Bolhuis\net al. [9] have argued that, in the evolution of vocal\nlearning, both common descent (homologous brain\nregions) and evolutionary convergence (distant taxa exhibiting functionally similar auditory-vocal learning) have\na role.\nReferences\n1 Darwin, C.

Overlapping here refers to a behaviour in which one singer begins a song\nwhile another is singing. Naguib & Mennill (2010) have contested\nboth these conclusions, maintaining (1) that overlapping is a signal\nand (2) that it is more specifically an aggressive signal. Below, we\nconsider their arguments on these two points in turn.\nOVERLAPPING AS A SIGNAL\nTo assess the more general hypothesis, that overlapping is\na signal, it is helpful to start by specifying a definition of signals. In\nour review, we cited Otte’s (1974, page 385) definition of signals as\n‘behavioral, physiological, or morphological characteristics fashioned or maintained by natural selection because they convey\ninformation to other organisms’. Following Williams (1966), Otte\n(1974, page 385) further noted that ‘a common and critical diffi-\nculty in treatments of communicative systems centers on the failure\nto distinguish between evolved functions and incidental effects’.\nOur major criticism of overlapping studies is that they have often\nfailed to address the problem that overlapping may occur incidentally, as a chance effect of two birds independently singing at the\nsame time. We argue, therefore, that the first step in considering\nwhether overlapping is a signal is to establish by comparison to\na null model that overlapping has not occurred only by chance. The\nuse of null models is of course a standard procedure in animal\nbehaviour, and a good example is close at hand: song type matching\n(replying to a bird with the same song type he has just sung) is\nroutinely compared against a null model before consideration of\nwhether it is an aggressive (or some other kind of) signal. Generally\nthe null expectation is simply the reciprocal of the bird’s repertoire\nsize (the probability that the bird would select that song type by\nchance). In cases where matching exceeds the random expectation,\nit is concluded that the birds intentionally match (e.g. Krebs et al.\n1981; Falls 1985; Stoddard et al. 1992; Rogers 2004; Anderson\net al. 2005; Burt & Vehrencamp 2005; Gammon et al. 2008); in\ncases where matching does not exceed random expectations, it is\nconcluded that the species does not use this tactic (Ballentine et al.\n2008). In several songbirds it has been found that birds song match\n(at greater than chance levels) their own song or a stranger’s song\nbut not a neighbour’s song, and this contrast can then lead to\na fruitful consideration of the function of song matching (Falls 1985;\nStoddard et al. 1992). We have simply suggested that this same\nstandard approach be taken with song overlapping.\nGiven the lack of evidence that overlapping ever occurs at above\nchance levels, Naguib & Mennill (2010, page E14) express\n* Correspondence: W.

It is a truism, of course, that\na null model will be wrong if the phenomenon is not random. As an\nalternative to a random model, Naguib & Mennill (2010, page E14)\nsuggest ‘a null model calculated on the basis of no overlapping\nwhatsoever’. This of course is not a null model at all, but rather an\nalternative hypothesis, that birds avoid overlapping, for which\nevidence needs to be provided. That is, the investigator needs to\nprovide evidence first that birds generally avoid overlapping,\nsecond, that under some special circumstances they do not, and,\nfinally, that these special circumstances cannot be explained by\nother hypotheses (such as the birds do not hear one another, or\nsimply are not interacting). Use of no overlap as a null model or\nbaseline would lead to the conclusion that two singers were\nintentionally overlapping even if they were actually both seeking to\nalternate, but were doing so with some level of error in execution.\nAny two singers that were actually ignoring each other would also\nbe concluded to be overlapping. The dangers of such a null model\nare obvious.\nNaguib & Mennill (2010) argue that even rare behaviours can\nhave a signal value, giving alarm calls as an example. By signal value\nthey presumably mean information content, which is a necessary\nbut not sufficient part of Otte’s (1974) definition. To have information content, a behaviour must have a nonrandom association\nwith some attribute of the actor or its environment. Although alarm\ncalls are rare when a predator is absent, they are common when the\npredator is present, as has been shown rigorously in a number of\ninstances (e.g. Seyfarth & Cheney 1980; Evans et al. 1993;\nZuberbühler 2000; Templeton et al. 2005). Comparable evidence,\nshowing that overlapping is relatively more common in agonistic\ncontexts, is scant for overlapping. Most studies of overlapping have\nused designs in which researchers have deliberately overlapped\ntheir subjects via interactive playback (see Table 1 in Naguib &\nMennill 2010), an approach that allows measurement of response\nto overlapping but does not allow assessment of the association of\noverlapping with context or with the subject’s phenotype or future\nbehaviour. To assess the information content of overlapping, it is\nnecessary to study either natural interactions between singers or\noverlapping responses to noninteractive playback.\nNaguib & Mennill (2010) discuss three studies that have examined overlapping in natural interactions, each of which we also\nexamined in our review (Searcy & Beecher 2009). Hultsch & Todt\n(1982) studied nocturnal singing interactions between male\nnightingales, Luscinia megarhynchos, and found that overall\noverlapping occurred at lower than random levels (Searcy &\nBeecher 2009). The most thorough studies of overlapping in\nnatural interactions have examined black-capped chickadees, Poecile atricapillus, using multimicrophone acoustic location systems\n(Fitzsimmons et al. 2008; Foote et al. 2008). In these studies,\noverlapping occurred at chance or below chance levels, and no\nassociations were found between overlapping and singer attributes\nsuch as dominance or external conditions such as distance between\nsingers. Again, neither intentional overlapping nor a signal value for\noverlapping was supported.\nNaguib & Mennill (2010) discuss five studies that have examined\noverlapping by subjects of noninteractive playback. We discussed\nfour of these in our review (Searcy & Beecher 2009) and stand by\nour conclusion that these as a whole provide no evidence that\noverlapping is intentional and little evidence that overlapping\nconveys aggressive intent. The fifth study, which we did not discuss\nin our review, illustrates some of the ambiguities of these studies as\na whole. Kunc et al. (2007) presented nightingales at night with\na fixed-rate playback, and found that males that eventually mated\noverlapped more of the playback songs during the premating\nperiod than during incubation. Males that remained bachelors\nshowed no such pattern over equivalent time periods. Kunc et al.\n(2007) concluded that males vary the level of aggression in their\nvocal interactions according to the stage in the breeding season.\nWith their measure of overlap, however, levels of overlapping\nexpected by chance depend directly on song rates, which in their\nstudy dropped substantially between the premating and incubation periods in mated males but not in bachelors. Thus the seasonal\npatterns of overlapping found in this study can be explained at least\nin part as the consequence of the well-known phenomenon of\na drop in song rate after pairing. No evidence was provided that\nlevels of overlapping were higher than chance in either mated or\nbachelor males during either part of the season, and comparison\nwith figures in Kunc et al. (2006) suggests that all levels were\nsubstantially below chance values (see calculations in Searcy &\nBeecher 2009). Finally, even if it could be shown that intentional\noverlapping by mated males decreased after pairing, this would not\nconstitute evidence that overlapping is aggressive, since it has not\nbeen shown that male nightingales are more aggressive before than\nafter pairing.\nThe bulk of the empirical studies adduced by Naguib & Mennill\n(2010) as evidence that overlapping is an aggressive signal examine\nresponses of subjects to being overlapped. The most common\nresponse in these studies is for males to interrupt their songs when\noverlapped by playback. For example, Mennill & Ratcliffe (2004a)\ncompared the responses of male black-capped chickadees to playback that either did or did not overlap them. Subjects did not\nrespond to overlapping with higher song rates, greater agitation or\ncloser approach. Instead, the effects of playback were on song\nlength and song timing: overlapped males sang shorter songs with\nmore variable time intervals between songs. Similarly, the most\nconsistent response of male nightingales to overlapping is to\ninterrupt more of their songs (Naguib 1999; Naguib & Kipper 2006;\nSchmidt et al. 2006). None of these effects could be said to show\na ‘stronger’ or ‘more intense’ response to overlapping. Instead,\neffects on song interruptions and intervals between songs are just\nwhat would be expected if males are seeking to avoid being jammed, and might be produced by any loud sound in the nearby\nenvironment. In fact, songbirds (including nightingales) have been\nshown to adjust the timing of their songs to avoid being overlapped\nby the songs of other species in natural interactions (Ficken et al.\n1974) and playback experiments (Brumm 2006).\nBecause adjustments in the timing of singing are so likely in\nresponse to any overlapping sound, singing responses have to be\ninterpreted with particular care in the case of overlapping playbacks. For example, song rate might increase in response to overlapping treatments because subjects are interrupting more of their\nsongs and starting over more often, without actually increasing the\noverall amount of song they produce. We would interpret a recent\nstudy by Amy et al. (in press) in just this way: in response to\noverlapping playback, great tits, Parus major, increased their song\nrate but sang shorter songs with fewer elements, while showing no\nchange in approach behaviour.\nBecause of the ambiguity of interpreting singing responses to\noverlapping, it is safer to assess aggressive response to overlapping\nplayback using approach or retreat from the loudspeaker, attack on\na mount, or use of other vocalizations or visual displays known to\nbe aggressive. Responses to overlapping on these types of measures\nhave been negative in most studies (Searcy & Beecher 2009; Naguib\n& Mennill 2010).\nWe acknowledge (as we did in Searcy & Beecher 2009) that\na few studies have shown more convincing evidence of response to\noverlapping, notably the eavesdropping experiments of Peake et al.\nW.A. Searcy, M.D. Beecher / Animal Behaviour 81 (2011) e1ee4e2(2001, 2002) and Mennill & Ratcliffe (2004b). Nevertheless, we feel\nthat most studies of response to overlapping are unconvincing, and\nthat a compelling case that overlapping is a signal in any species\nrequires evidence of above random levels of overlapping in at least\nsome circumstance, together with evidence of a nonrandom association of overlapping with some characteristic of the signaller or\nits environment.\nOVERLAPPING AS AN AGGRESSIVE SIGNAL\nIn our review, we suggested three criteria for establishing that\na signal is aggressive (in the sense of threatening): (1) a demonstration that the signal increases in aggressive contexts, (2)\na demonstration that the signal predicts aggressive escalation, and\n(3) a demonstration that receivers respond to the signal. We\nconcluded that there was little evidence that overlapping met\neither the first or the second criterion (Searcy & Beecher 2009), and\nwe do not see much in the compilation of studies presented by\nNaguib & Mennill (2010) to change our minds. Instead, most of the\nstudies presented by Naguib & Mennill (2010) bear on the third\ncriterion, that of receiver response.\nWe have already argued above that many of the receiver\nresponse studies find responses to overlapping songs that might be\ngiven to any loud sound, which does not constitute convincing\nevidence that overlapping is a signal. Again we concede that a few\nstudies give more convincing evidence of the sorts of responses\nthat one would expect to be given only to within-species signals.\nEven in these cases, however, it is difficult to maintain that receiver\nresponse alone demonstrates that a signal is threatening. If\nreceivers show a strong aggressive response to a signal, that\nresponse can be used to argue that the signal is especially aggressive, with the receiver showing a strong response because the\nthreat is serious; conversely, if receivers show a weak aggressive\nresponse, that can also be used to argue that the signal is especially\naggressive, with the receiver showing a weak response because it is\nintimidated. If both outcomes can be used to argue that a signal is\naggressive, then the test cannot be regarded as convincing.\nTHE WAY FORWARD\nAlthough we remain highly sceptical about existing evidence\nthat overlapping is an aggressive signal or even a signal at all, we\nreadily admit that new evidence might someday be found that\nwould change our minds, at least with respect to particular species\nand contexts. Therefore it seems valuable to end by stipulating\nwhat evidence we would consider most convincing. To show that\noverlapping is a signal, it is first critical to show that overlapping\noccurs at higher than random levels under some circumstances.\nAgain, these circumstances might be rather narrow. For example, it\nis clear that in black-capped chickadees, overlapping does not\nconsistently occur at above random levels in aggressive interactions\nas a whole, and that dominant individuals do not consistently\noverlap others at above random levels (Fitzsimmons et al. 2008;\nFoote et al. 2008). Nevertheless, it still is possible that overlapping might occur at above chance levels in the subset of\naggressive interactions that are most intense, or when the most\ndominant individuals are interacting with the least dominant, or\nwhen the most dominant individuals are just on the point of\nattacking the least dominant, and so forth. Whether or not above\nchance levels of overlapping are ever found, it is important to\nprovide an estimate of a random level of overlapping whenever an\nobserved level is given; this is a rule that has rarely been followed\nto date in the overlapping literature, although it has been widely\nfollowed in the matching literature.\nSecond, more studies need to be done in which the information\ncontent of overlapping is assessed. Again, such assessments cannot\nbe made using experimental designs in which researchers overlap\nsubjects via playback, but rather require studies that either\nexamine natural interactions or that allow subjects to overlap\nfixed-rate playback. Such studies might investigate associations of\noverlapping frequency with characteristics of the singer (dominance, size, age, etc.) or context (close interaction versus distant,\nterritorial intrusion versus no intrusion, etc.). As a test of whether\noverlapping is specifically an aggressive signal, experiments that\nexamine whether overlapping predicts aggressive escalation would\nbe particularly valuable (Searcy & Beecher 2009). Such studies\nshould either control for song rates or use a measure of overlapping\nthat does not depend on song rate (Searcy & Beecher 2009), and\nshould provide estimates of random expectations for overlapping\nas argued above.\nFinally, once some signal value of overlapping is established for\na species, interactive playback can be used to test for response to\nbeing overlapped. Here it seems important to use a control treatment (in addition to the normal control of nonoverlapping playback) in which subjects are overlapped with another sound of the\nsame amplitude and similar frequency characteristics as the\nconspecific songs used for overlap. Such a control would allow\nresearchers to discriminate between aggressive responses and\njamming avoidance.\nWe thank Caglar Akcay, Marc Naguib and two anonymous\nreferees for discussion.\nReferences\nAmy, M., Sprau, P., de Goede, P, & Naguib, M.

Surprisingly, however, corresponding research into their natural communication has largely been neglected. We address this issue with a first playback study on the natural vocal behaviour of bonobos. Bonobos produce five acoustically distinct call types when finding food, which they regularly mix together into longer call sequences. We found that individual call types were relatively poor indicators of food quality, while context specificity was much greater at the call sequence level. We therefore investigated whether receivers could extract meaning about the quality of food encountered by the caller by integrating across different call sequences. We first trained four captive individuals to find two types of foods, kiwi (preferred) and apples (less preferred) at two different locations. We then conducted naturalistic playback experiments during which we broadcasted sequences of four calls, originally produced by a familiar individual responding to either kiwi or apples. All sequences contained the same number of calls but varied in the composition of call types. Following playbacks, we found that subjects devoted significantly more search effort to the field indicated by the call sequence. Rather than attending to individual calls, bonobos attended to the entire sequences to make inferences about the food encountered by a caller. These results provide the first empirical evidence that bonobos are able to extract information about external events by attending to vocal sequences of other individuals and highlight the importance of call combinations in their natural communication system.\n\nIntroduction\nA growing body of research on the communicative behaviour of non-human primates has demonstrated that their vocalisations can convey a considerably rich amount of information that is meaningful to receivers (e.g. [1]). For instance, field experiments with various primate species have shown that acoustically distinct alarm calls can inform listeners about specific types of dangers (e.g. [2]–[5]). In some species, there is evidence that signallers produce strings of acoustically variable calls composed in context-specific ways (e.g. [6]–[8]). For example, black-and-white Colobus monkeys (Colobus polykomos, C. guereza) produce two types of vocalisations to predators, which are arranged in event-specific sequences that are seemingly meaningful to others [8].\n\nFood discovery is another event type during which some primates produce highly context-specific vocalisations. Since food is often patchily distributed and seasonally dispersed, food calls can provide listeners with a useful means to access foraging patches more effectively, while callers appear to gain mainly social benefits [9]–[10]. The production of food-associated calls is not restricted to primates but found in other mammals and some birds, e.g. Gallus gallus [11], although relatively little is still known about the type of information conveyed by the calls. At the simplest level, food calls are a basic physiological response indicating that the caller has found something desirable, as demonstrated by receivers approaching food calls more rapidly than other calls [12]–[13] or by triggering foraging behaviour [14]. In some species, food calls appear to provide more detailed information about the food item itself, such as its quality or divisibility, which can be encoded by changes in call rates [12], [15]–[17] or acoustic structure [18]–[19]. For example, Rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) produce up to five different food-associated call types [20], which receivers discriminate based on differences in their referential features, rather than their acoustic properties alone [21].\n\nAmong the great apes, chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) produce specific calls when discovering food, the ‘rough grunts’ [22]–[23]. The morphology of this call type co-varies with the caller's personal food preference both in captivity and the wild [24]. In a naturalistic playback experiment, it was demonstrated that acoustic variation in this call influences the foraging decisions of receivers, suggesting that the acoustic structure of this graded signal provides meaningful information to other chimpanzees about the quality of food encountered by the caller [25].\n\nWhat exactly governs receiver responses, however, is a matter of ongoing debate. For instance it is not clear whether receivers respond directly to the calls' physical features or their referential nature, i.e. the causal relation between calls and contexts [26]–[27]. Similarly, signalling is often said to be non-cooperative with signallers merely producing ‘natural’ information in response to biologically relevant events, while any representational content is largely generated by the listeners [28]. These problems are unsolved because the psychological states experienced by primates during call production and perception are rarely investigated. In one recent study, however, food call production in wild chimpanzees was found to co-vary with the presence and arrival of long-term allies, suggesting these calls may be used as a flexible social strategy [10].\n\nVery little is known about how our other closest relative, the bonobo (Pan paniscus), naturally communicates about events in the external world. This is despite the fact that some individuals have been remarkably capable in mastering artificial language systems [29]–[30]. In one recent systematic study, Clay & Zuberbühler [31] demonstrated that bonobos also vocalize upon encountering food, but that there are important differences between the two Pan species. Whilst both species produce food ‘grunts’, bonobos additionally give four acoustically distinguishable tonal calls when finding food (barks, peeps, peep-yelps, and yelps), which although lying on a graded scale, can be statistically discriminated from one another [31]. Barks are longest in duration, characterised by a distinctive pointed shape and numerous visible harmonic bands. Whilst peeps are also high pitched, they are temporally shorter than barks (and all other calls), with few harmonic bands and had a flat frequency contour. Yelps and peep-yelps are lower in pitch and although share acoustically similarities, yelps possess a marked downward stroke frequency contour, in contrast to the arched contour of the peep-yelps. In terms of production, peeps and barks are most frequently, but not exclusively, given to preferred foods, while yelps and grunts are more often, but not exclusively, given to less preferred foods. Peep-yelps are produced broadly, although they also tend to occur more to mid- and lesser-preferred foods. In sum, the link between individual call types and perceived food quality is only probabilistic in bonobos. One important consequence of this is that different food calls themselves do not appear to allow listeners to make strong predictions about the type of food encountered by the caller. However, in contrast to chimpanzees, bonobos regularly combine different call types together into longer mixed sequences. The composition of these food call sequences related reliably to food quality, suggesting that listeners can gain information from attending to the call sequences. The hypothesis of meaningful call combinations has been put forward before for bonobos, but has never been tested formally [32]–[33].\n\nIn the current study, we examined whether listeners were able to extract meaningful information relating to food quality by attending to the composition of these heterogeneous call sequences. To this end, we conducted naturalistic playback experiments in which subjects heard different types of food all sequences, and their subsequent foraging responses were analysed.\n\nResults\nThe study was conducted at Twycross Zoo, UK, between April and July 2009. Individuals were permanently separated into two subgroups that occupied different indoor facilities but shared the same outdoor area via two separate doors in the morning or afternoon, respectively (fig. 1; table 1). We conducted playback experiments in which we broadcast food-calls of an individual of the morning subgroup responding to either high-quality food (kiwi) or low-quality food (apple) to all members of the afternoon subgroup before releasing them into the outdoor enclosure. Our general aim was to simulate a morning group individual discovering food of high or low quality in the outdoor area shortly before the release of the afternoon subgroup. We also included a control condition in which no food calls were played. We then assessed the foraging behaviours of receivers at previously learned locations for high-quality and low-quality food in the outdoor enclosure (fig. 1).\n\nFigure 1.

This was particularly evident in the control condition (when no food was presented), in which individuals were more likely to visit the kiwi field first and more often, as well as devoting more foraging effort to it compared to the apple field (fig. 2). Despite this baseline bias, playbacks of food-associated calls had an overall significant effect on the individuals' first choice of fields (χ2 (2) = 16.347, p<.001; Pearson chi-square, two-tailed; fig. 2a). Playback of call sequences originally given to kiwi resulted in an increase in first visits to the kiwi field, compared to baseline or apple trials. However, this change failed to reach significance due to a ceiling effect caused by the strong baseline bias for kiwi (First arrivals to kiwi site per individual: median N trials: control condition = 3.0 (50% of trials); kiwi playback condition = 6.0 (86%); apple playback condition = 5.0 (50%), all one-way χ2 tests: p>.05). Playback of call sequences originally give to apple resulted in a significant increase in the number of first visits to the apple field, compared to baseline or kiwi trials (First arrivals to apple site, per individual: median N trials: control condition = 0.0; kiwi playback condition = 0.0; apple playback condition = 4.0 (40%); both control and kiwi vs. apple: χ2 (1, N = 17) = 13.235, p<.001, with Bonferroni corrected alpha .0169). Hearing food-associated call sequences, in other words, influenced the bonobos' foraging decisions against their pre-existing food preference biases. We conducted this first analysis at the group level because individuals almost always foraged as a cohesive unit and, when released, entered the outside enclosure almost simultaneously (table S1).\n\nFigure 2. Box plots indicating foraging responses of bonobos (N = 4) following playbacks of food-associated calls given to high value (kiwi) or low value (apple) foods.\nFigure 2\n\nOpen in a new tab\n(a) Site of first entry expressed as a median proportion of the individual's median choices per condition; (b) median number of visits per trial; (c) median time spent foraging following playback (s). Box plots illustrate medians, inter-quartile ranges, and highest and lowest values, excluding outliers.\n\nNext, we determined whether hearing playbacks influenced the number of visits the group made to the two fields (fig. 2b). Again, we found a significant effect of playback condition on the median number of visits made by the group to both the kiwi field (χ2 = 6.486, df = 2, p = .034; two-tailed exact Kruskal-Wallis test) and the apple field (χ2 = 10.532, df = 2, p = .002; two-tailed exact Kruskal-Wallis test). Post-hoc, pair-wise comparisons using a Bonferroni correction (corrected alpha = .0169) revealed that individuals visited the ‘kiwi’ field more often after hearing ‘kiwi’ call sequences compared to control trials (mediancontrol = 0.5; mediankiwi = 1.0; medianapple = 1.0; N visits to kiwi field, ‘kiwi’ playback vs. control: Mann-Whitney U = 4.5, p = .015). Conversely, we found that individuals visited the apple field more often after hearing playback of ‘apple’ call sequences compared to the control condition (mediancontrol = 0.0; mediankiwi = 0.5; medianapple = 1.0; N visits to apple field, ‘apple’ playback vs control: U = 3, p = .002).\n\nFinally, hearing playbacks of food-associated call sequences had a significant effect on the foraging time devoted by the group at both the kiwi site (χ2 = 6.902, df = 2, p = .026; two-tailed exact Kruskal-Wallis test) and the apple site (χ2 = 10.876, df = 2, p = .002; two-tailed exact Kruskal-Wallis test; fig. 2c). Pair-wise comparisons (Bonferroni corrected alpha = .0169) revealed that individuals spent more time at the kiwi location after hearing ‘kiwi’ call sequences compared to control condition (mediancontrol = 2.25s; mediankiwi = 16.50s; medianapple = 5.75s; Kiwi site, ‘kiwi’ playback vs. control: Mann-Whitney U = 5, p = .022,) or hearing ‘apple’ call sequences (‘kiwi’ playback vs. ‘apple’ playback: U = 15.5, p = .058). Likewise, individuals spent more time in the apple field after hearing playbacks of ‘apple’ call sequences compared to control trials (mediancontrol = 0.0s; median apple = 9.5s; mediankiwi = 1.5; apple field, ‘apple’ playback vs. control: Mann-Whitney U = 6, p = .015). Although there was a trend for spending more time foraging at apple after hearing apple playbacks compared to kiwi playbacks, the result did not reach significance (apple vs. kiwi playbacks: U = 20, p>.05).\n\nAll previous analyses were based on non-parametric comparisons at the group level. We selected this analysis strategy to avoid problems with data interdependency and type-two clustering errors [34] at the cost of a substantial reduction in statistical power. Thus, in a second set of analyses we relied on Generalized Linear Mixed Models based on Poisson distributions and log link functions (GLMM), which allowed us to maximise the amount of data available by considering the contributions of individuals. We accounted for individual identity by entering it as a random factor, although it may be argued that combining individuals into one model will not completely eliminate the problem of interdependency, The GLMM procedure is an extension of the more widely known General Linear Model (GLM) and is particularly useful for this study because it relaxes assumptions of normal data distribution and an identity link [35].\n\nThis GLMM analysis revealed the same main effects, with a significant interaction between playback type and the number of visits to the two fields (two-tailed GLMM, F (2,178) = 5.037, p = .007; fig. 2b; table S2). Pair-wise comparisons revealed that individuals visited the kiwi field significantly more often after hearing ‘kiwi’ call sequences compared to control trials (p = 0.028). They also visited the apple field significantly more often after hearing ‘apple’ call sequences compared to control and kiwi conditions (p<.001; p = 0.008, respectively).\n\nFinally, hearing playbacks of food-associated call sequences had a significant effect on the foraging time devoted by each of the four individuals in the two fields (two-tailed GLMM: F (2, 178) = 120.772, p<.001; fig. 2c, table S3). Pair-wise comparisons revealed that individuals spent more time at the kiwi location after hearing ‘kiwi’ call sequences than ‘apple’ call sequences or compared to control trials (both p<.001). Likewise, individuals spent more time in the apple field after hearing playbacks of ‘apple’ call sequences compared to ‘kiwi’ call sequences or compared to control trials (both p<.001).\n\nForaging errors and integration across the call sequence\nA key indicator of representationally-based signal processing is that subjects sometimes make mistakes, particularly with signals that are ambiguous or only weakly correlated with specific external events [28]. In our sample, some call sequences were better indicators of high or low food quality than others in terms of call composition, suggesting that if subjects made mistakes then this should happen in response to the more ambiguous sequences (e.g. visiting the apple field after hearing a kiwi sequence). To address this, we assigned a cumulative value to each sequence, based on its call composition. Each call contributed with a value that reflected its association strength with high preference food (table 2). For instance, in natural calling sequences, ‘barks’ were given six times more frequently to high than low preference food (proportion of ‘barks’ in calling sequences to high preference foods = 0.24, vs. low-preference foods = 0.04). Similarly, peeps were given 1.86 times more frequently to high than low preference food (proportion of ‘peeps’ in calling sequences to high preference foods = 0.52 vs. low-preference food = 0.28), and so on. These relative differences resulted in the following cumulative values: B = 6.00, P = 1.86, PY = 0.52, Y = 0.12. We also assigned an ordinal scale, based on the strength of their relationship to high-preference foods, with ‘barks’ being given most frequently to high-preference foods and yelps most infrequently: B = 4, P = 3, PY = 2, Y = 1 (see fig. 3, table 3).\n\nTable 2.

Results mirror what was previously described from a larger data set from two groups in San Diego (31) showing that although all calls were produced at least once in the high and low contexts, their relative frequency varies with food preference. Barks are produced most typically in response to high value foods; peeps occur often to high value foods, peep-yelps are produced more often to medium-lower value foods, while yelps were typically produced the lower value foods. Grunts were rarely produced in natural call sequences at Twycross, with only 2 individuals producing them, both for low value foods.\n\nFigure 3.

Cells marked in bold represent 'response errors' where individuals exerted more foraging effort in the incongruent field. Details of how cumulative values were calculated are found in Figure 3. (B = bark, P = peep, PY = peep yelp, Y = yelp). CVO: Cumulative value (ordinal); CVC: Cumulative value (cardinal); Kiwi bias: Relative bias towards the kiwi field.\n\nThere was a significant positive correlation between subjects’ foraging effort in the kiwi field and the overall cumulative food value as assessed by the composition of the sequence (time spent: cardinal scale Spearman's rho: N = 17 rs = 0.585, p = .014, fig. 3; ordinal scale: N = 17, rs = 0.575, p = .016). Inspection at the level of individual trials indicated an almost perfect separation of sequences given to apples and kiwis by the cumulative sequence value generated by the constituent calls. One exception was a call sequence given to apples (PY-B-B-PY), which interestingly also triggered almost twice as much searching in the (wrong) kiwi compared to the apple field. Also interesting were two responses to kiwi sequences, which only triggered weak searching in the kiwi field. However, in both cases, search effort in the apple field was also unusually low, suggesting that subjects were generally unmotivated to forage (table 3). In sum, the foraging effort was a strong reflection of the cumulative ‘good food’ score encoded by the sequence.\n\nDiscussion\nHuman-enculturated bonobos have long been known for their extraordinary representational and communication skills [29]–[30], [36]–[37], but their natural communication behaviour has hardly been investigated. Our study provides progress to this end in showing that bonobos can increase their foraging success by attending to each other's call sequences. Our key finding was that subjects were able to direct their foraging effort to specific locations according to the call sequence presented to them. Whilst we found an unsurprising baseline preference to the high-preference food site, we found that playbacks of high-preference food call sequences resulted in an even greater amount of foraging effort at this site, indicating the calls were meaningful to the receivers. Furthermore, although lack of interest at the low-food preference apple site was to be expected (see baseline trials) we found a significant increase in search effort at this site that only occurred after hearing sequences associated with low-preference food. This result further suggests that individuals incorporated information extracted from the food call sequences to optimise their foraging strategies, in some cases against pre-existing foraging biases.\n\nAlthough it would be interesting to investigate the mechanism of decision making within the group, we were not able to address this point in our study due to the constraints of working with subjects that were part of a public display (with Zoo regulations prohibiting separation). It is likely that there were individual differences in the ability to assign meaning to the different call sequences used as playback stimuli, either due to individual differences in knowledge or other more immediate factors, such as receiver attention or motivation during the trials. Despite these constraints, we are able to draw the conservative conclusion that at least one individual in our group was able to comprehend the information conveyed by the call sequences, though the results of some trials suggested that several or all group members made their own independent foraging decisions prior to being released into the enclosure. For example, we found that, across trials, different individuals arrived at the food sites first and, in some trials, individuals diverged in their first choices (table S1).\n\nOur results also show that, although chimpanzees and bonobos are phylogenetically closely related, they appear to communicate about food in considerably different ways. In contrast to chimpanzees, who produce an acoustically graded call type that co-varies with food quality [26], bonobos regularly mix several acoustically distinct food call types into heterogeneous strings of vocalisations. Rather than at the level of individual calls, food quality appears related to the probabilistic composition of heterogeneous call sequences [31]. Results from our playback experiment indicate that rather than attending to individual call types, receivers took into account the relative proportions of different calls within the sequence and extracted meaning by integrating information from across the call units.\n\nIn addition, the generation of more foraging errors in structurally ambiguous call sequences (which were less strongly indicative of high or low preference foods) indicated that the information extracted from the stimuli sequences was influencing the foraging decisions of the receivers. In a recent discussion, Stegmann [28] argued that in contrast to ‘natural information’, which does not allow for errors, the generation of misrepresentations and errors is a defining feature of what we consider as ‘semantic information’ in animal signals.\n\nWhilst there is a growing body of evidence that numerous monkey species produce strings or sequences of acoustically variable calls composed in context-specific ways, evidence for meaningful signal combinations in apes has been poor (although see [38]). A recent study of gorilla gestural sequences failed to find evidence of syntactic organisation or corresponding semantic content [39]. Results from the current study provide the first empirical evidence that call combinations do play a role in bonobo communication in the foraging context. However, it is important to note that we also did not find any evidence for syntactic rules or that the sequencing structure itself was itself semantically relevant. Thus, although call combinations appear to represent a useful means of communicating information in bonobos, the manner in which bonobos use call combinations contrasts the way linguistic units are combined and structured in human language. This finding highlights the importance of studying non-human primate communication as a means to identify the features of the language faculty that are uniquely human.\n\nOne recurrent topic in the animal communication literature is whether signals given in response to external events, such as in this study, should be conceptualised as ‘referential’ or a mere readout of a caller's motivational or internal state [26], [40]–[41]. Great apes, especially chimpanzees and bonobos, are often described as exceedingly ‘emotional’, suggesting that arousal-based explanations may be more in line with the nature of the phenomenon described here (e.g. [26]). In particular, sequences containing a greater amount of calls with presumably high emotional valence may lead receivers to search at the high-value food site. Although we do not discount the integral role motivation plays in animal communication [26], [41], gaining meaningful measurements of internal state or arousal have so far proved very challenging, and thus it has often proved more empirically fruitful to focus on the relation between receiver response and external variables that can be manipulated and measured experimentally [1], [42]. Furthermore, even calls with presumably high motivational content (as may be the case for food discovery) are still able to inform receivers about the external world. This has been demonstrated by studies showing that, regardless of the signaller's motivational state during call production, calls can provide listeners with representational information about external objects and events, in way that can be studied experimentally [1], [27], [41], [43]–[45]. Recent work on the alarm call responses of meerkats (Suricata suricata) for example, has demonstrated that both emotional and referential information are encoded into the same signal and develop on different ontogenetic time scales [45]. Meaningful progress will focus more specifically on the motivational experience of the caller and how this influences signal production.\n\nHow do receivers extract information from these call sequences? Are they attending to individual calls or do they perceive the sequence as a holistic unit? For example, it could be argued that an increasing number of high-pitched calls, such as peeps and barks, increases the perceived gestalt of the sequence in a discrete way, enabling individuals to make foraging decisions without paying attention to individual calls. Further research will be necessary to address this issue in more detail.\n\nAnother related question is whether receivers process vocalisations purely based on their acoustic properties, or whether they attach some semantic value to them. For example, subjects may have learned the contingencies of this particular experiment, e.g. that high-pitched vocalisations were associated with food at one specific location, without any understanding of more general relations between a caller's perceived food quality and the vocal signals produced in response. However, research on food-associated calls of rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta), another primate with a graded vocal system, has demonstrated that individuals categorise calls based on their meaning, not just their acoustic structure alone [31]. Whether bonobos process their own calls in the same way remains open as a topic for future research.\n\nA final unresolved question concerns the function of food call production in bonobos. In capuchins (Cebus capucinus), food calls are thought to provide ecological benefits, functioning to announce food ownership and a willingness to defend, thereby resulting in reducing foraging competition from others [46]. In red-bellied tamarins (Saguinas labiatus), it has been suggested that food calls are not solely a function of arousal in the presence of highly desirable food patches, but may provide social benefits by attracting allies, even at the cost of increasing feeding competition [9]. A similar effect has recently been indicated in wild male chimpanzees who were found to call more in the presence of close allies and even recommenced calling upon their arrival [10]. For bonobos, it has also been suggested that individuals receive benefits from producing food calls, for instance by attracting mates or potential allies [47]. Further work investigating the interplay and influence of social and ecological variables on the production of food-associated calls in bonobos is required to explore the adaptive significance of these calls in this species.\n\nMaterials and Methods\nStudy site and subjects\nThe study was conducted at Twycross Zoo, UK, between April and July 2009.Individuals were permanently separated into two subgroups that occupied separate indoor facilities but shared the same outdoor area via two separate doors (fig. 1). Subgroup A consisted of 5 individuals (2 adult males and females, 1 juvenile female; range 6–29 years); subgroup B consisted of 6 individuals (1 adult male, 3 adult females, 1 juvenile male, 1 juvenile female; range 4–32 years; table 1). Each subgroup was housed in one of two separated heated indoor halls (62 m2) with additional sleeping areas (22 m2) and both facilities were separately connected to an outdoor enclosure (588 m2). There was no visual contact between indoor and outdoor enclosures, although vocalizations produced outside could be heard indoors. Both subgroups were fed a range of fruits and vegetables twice per day in a scatter feed. Water was freely available. Bonobos were provided with regular enrichment materials and feeds (such as branches, seeds, grapes or frozen juice) as well as supplements such as yoghurt, egg and bread.\n\nEthical statement\nThe Twycross Zoo Ethics and Management Committee and the Zoo Research Coordinator and gave full ethical approval to this behavioural, non-invasive study, which complied with the ethical guidelines set out by the British and Irish Association of Zoos and Aquariums (BIAZA). During all stages of the study, we took steps to ensure that the welfare of all animals was not compromised. No individual showed distress during any part of this study and their participation throughout was voluntary. In order to reduce stress and to comply with Zoo guidelines, we did not separate any individual in any stage of this study.\n\nExperimental Design\nThe basic design was to simulate a member of the morning subgroup A finding food shortly before the midday switchover, in order to investigate whether this influenced the subsequent foraging behaviour of subgroup B members. The study consisted of four stages: (1) food preference tests, (2) recording of food-specific calling sequences, (3) establishment of two feeding areas, and (4) playback experiments.\n\n1. Food preference tests\nFirst, we conducted food preference tests to identify a highly valued and a lesser-valued food. Equal sized piles of two foods were placed next to each other on the ground and the first choice was recorded for each individual, repeated across four days, once per day. For each individual, we created a preference matrix based on the percentage of trials in which each food was selected over the other food type across the four sessions. These percentages were then combined to give a cumulative preference score per food, and ranked accordingly (table S4). From eight familiar foods, kiwis and apples were consistently ranked as high and low by all individuals, while both still reliably triggering food calls. We thus selected kiwis and apples as our experimental foods.\n\n2. Recording calls\nFrom April to May 2009, we recorded food-associated call sequences given by all individuals feeding in the outdoor enclosure (fig. 4). This allowed us to build up a sound library of call sequences given to kiwi and apples by individuals of the ‘morning’ subgroup for the subsequent playback experiments and to compare their behaviour with a previous study on bonobos [31] (table 2). We recorded vocalizations using a Sennheiser MKH816T directional microphone and a Marantz PMD660 solid-state recorder. Verbal comments were given and later transcribed. We transferred recordings onto a Toshiba Laptop (Equium 1.8 GHz) at a sampling rate of 44.1 kHz with 16-bit accuracy. To control for hunger levels, novelty, and other factors, we only recorded calls produced during first morning feeds. We excluded calls produced by individuals interacting with more than one type of food or when caller identity was uncertain. Calls were recorded from a range of locations from a distance of 2–15 m.\n\nFigure 4.

Recordings of the corresponding call sequences are available as audio S1 and audio S2.\n\n3. Foraging training\nDuring this same period, we established two outdoor foraging patches for the afternoon subgroup in a daily foraging task. Before their midday release, a caretaker hid finely cut pieces (1 cm2 pieces, total 300 g) of either apple or kiwi in the grass in one of two 30 m2 fields so that they were not visible from a distance. The two fields were on slopes, equidistant to the door (21 m); the distance between them was 8 m. Both field areas were equal (length top = 6.5 m; width = 4.0 m; length bottom = 8.5 m), starting with a flat descent and finishing at the concrete border of the enclosure wall. Kiwi and apple feeds were presented in random order so individuals could not predict which patch was baited so had to inspect the two areas separately. Only one food type was ever provided and no other food or enrichment was provided during training. The keeper always visited both areas, even if no food was placed, to prevent individuals from learning noises associated with scattering food. There were 16 training days for each food type, and 10 control days during which no food was provided. We filmed the individuals' foraging behaviour and kept a daily record of each individual's food encounters (text S1, table S5). Individuals soon learned the two feeding fields and quickly formed a preference for the kiwi field.\n\n4. Playback experiments\nIn the final step, we conducted playback experiments in which call sequences of members of the morning subgroup were played to individuals in the afternoon subgroup (text S1). The experimental routine was as follows. Around midday, the morning subgroup was brought inside for a seed feed. Live radio broadcasting was played via an inside keeper door to prevent subjects from the morning group from hearing the stimuli (i.e. their own calls) in the subsequent experiment. This was effective as no vocal responses were elicited from any individual during playback trials (except for one apple trial, which was excluded from analysis). Meanwhile, individuals from the afternoon subgroup were waiting to be released through their own door. Beforehand, three key manipulations were carried out. First, a keeper entered the outdoor enclosure from a side door to mimic placing food (none was provisioned). Individuals were familiar with this routine from the previous foraging training. They could not see the event, but could hear the associated sounds. After the keeper's return, subjects heard the opening sounds of the door, which connected the morning subgroup to the outdoor enclosure (to suggest a re-entry of the morning subgroup), although, in reality, no subject was released. A trial was conducted only if (a) no vocalizations had been produced by the morning subgroup for at least 1 minute, (b) individuals of the afternoon subgroup were waiting close (<1–2 m) to the door and not distracted by social activities (play, agonistic, sex) for at least 1 minute; (c) there was no rain or excessive wind outdoors. Communication between a keeper who stayed indoors with the bonobos and the experimenter, who stayed outdoors, was maintained with two-way radios. If these conditions were not met, the trial was either delayed or, in some cases, abandoned. If conditions were met, the afternoon subgroup then heard a 4 s playback of a series of four equally spaced calls extracted from a natural call sequence to either apple or kiwi (to simulate a morning subgroup member finding apple or kiwi) played from their outdoor enclosure (fig. S1). During control trials, all features of the procedure remained the same except that no stimulus was played. One minute after the playback (a sufficient time period for morning subgroup to ‘return’ indoors), the afternoon subgroup was released and their foraging behaviour was monitored for up to 10 min using a camcorder with additional verbal comments. We simultaneously recorded all vocal responses with professional sound recording equipment as previously described. During experimental and control trials, no food was ever provided on either field (to rule out visually-based foraging). To reduce the possibility of extinction, we interspersed a number of refresher days between each trial, i.e. between 1–4 days during which we provided either kiwi or apple pieces on the corresponding fields in random order (N = 28 total).\n\nZoo regulations prohibited separation of group members (due to stress provoked) so all individuals were released simultaneously into the outdoor enclosure and behavioural response measures were collected while individuals interacted with each other as a group. A total of 28 trials were conducted; three were discarded due to poor weather (preventing the bonobos from being released), one due to unexpected vocalizations (see before), and one due to a communication problem between keeper and experimenter. The remaining 23 trials consisted of N = 10 apple, N = 7 kiwi, and N = 6 control trials, which were completed by four individuals (GM, CK, KH, LU).\n\nThe remaining two individuals (DT, JS) were excluded. JS did not complete the training phase and was not motivated to go outdoors due to his low social rank. DT showed no evidence of having learned the food locations during the training phase and showed little interest during the playback phase, only completing 5 of 23 trials, not enough for statistical analyses.\n\nWe extracted systematic data on three dependent variables across the different conditions: (a) patch first visited (kiwi vs. apple), (b) time spent actively foraging in each patch (time trespassing, sitting, resting, or sleeping were subtracted), (c) total number of visits per patch (N times entering and exiting the patch areas interrupted by at least one bout of foraging). Because data from individuals were interdependent (we were unable to separate individuals so all individuals foraged together), we conducted our principal analyses at the group level using the median scores for individuals combined per trial. The nature of the data distribution for this method meant that only non-parametric statistics were employed.\n\nWhilst measuring the central tendency of the group across trials reduces the problems of interdependency of the data and type-two clustering errors [34], the cost is a substantial reduction in statistical power. Furthermore, rather than using the foraging behaviours of receivers (upon which our hypothesis is based) as the unit of analysis, the unit of analysis becomes the trials in which the responses of a groups of receivers were measured. We therefore conducted a second analysis using Generalized Linear Mixed Models (Poisson distribution-log link) in order to address the problem of statistical power. The Generalised Linear Mixed Model Procedure (GLMM) is an extension of the General Linear Mixed Model, characterised by a flexible generalization of ordinary least squares regression. The procedure relaxes the assumptions of normal distribution and identity link [35], a crucial prerequisite for the ordinal data of this study. The GLMM procedure enables individual identity to be accounted for (by entering it as a random factor), although this does not completely address the problem of potential inter-dependency in the individuals' foraging decisions.", "affiliations": [{"university": "University of St Andrews", "country": "UK", "discipline": "Psychology"}, {"university": "Twycross Zoo", "country": "UK", "discipline": "Zoology"}], "species_categories": ["Primate"], "specialized_species": ["Bonobos", "Rhesus monkeys", "Chimpanzees", "Black-and-white Colobus monkeys"], "computational_stages": ["Meaning Identification"], "linguistic_features": ["Semanticity", "Discreteness and Syntax"], "status": "saved", "created_at": "2026-01-13T12:49:59.883072", "updated_at": "2026-01-20T17:43:12.286227", "committed_at": "2026-01-20T17:43:14.327780"}

SUZUKI #\nLaboratory of Animal Ecology, Department of Life Science, Rikkyo University, 3–34–1 Nishi-Ikebukuro,\nToshima, Tokyo 171 – 8501, Japan\nAbstract Willow Tits Poecile montanus produce calls when they discover food\nsources. These calls function to attract conspecific and heterospecific individuals to\nthe food site, thereby facilitating the formation of mixed-species foraging flocks.\nSince individuals may gain feeding/anti-predator benefits while foraging in mixedspecies flocks, the ability of food discoverers to signal food presence would be of\nadaptive value. Here, I tested this idea by comparing the calls of Willow Tits between\nfood and non-food contexts. Field observations at artificial feeders showed that Wil-\nlow Tits typically produce calls composed of a single note type (tää note) when dis-\ncovering food supplies, whereas they usually combine two distinct note types (intro-\nductory and tää notes) when moving through forests without a food source. These\nresults indicate that Willow Tits use subtle variation in the note composition of calls\nto discriminate between food and non-food contexts, and this may serve to regulate\nthe movements and cohesion of mixed-species flocks.\nKey words Acoustic communication, Call, Food discovery, Poecile montanus, Willow\nTit\nORNITHOLOGICAL\nSCIENCE\n© The Ornithological Society\nof Japan 2012\nSome social-living bird species produce intensive\nor specific calls when they discover food sources\n(reviewed by Hauser 1996). Such calls typically\nattract other individuals to the food site and are emit-\nted when the individuals that find food sources can\ngain more benefit by sharing the food than by monop-\nolizing it (Mangel 1990). For example, House Spar-\nrows Passer domesticus increase the rate of “chirrup”\ncalls when discovering divisible food sources, thereby\nrecruiting other conspecifics to the food site (Elgar\n1986). This enables the food discoverers to reduce\nthe time needed for anti-predatory vigilance while\nforaging (Elgar & Catterall 1981). Similarly, Com-\nmon Ravens Corvus corax produce “yells” when\napproaching rich but defended food sources, and the\ncallers may facilitate access to food defended by\ndominants (Heinrich & Marzluff 1991; Bugnyar et al.\n2001). In both cases, variation in the acoustic struc-\nture of calls would allow the food discoverers to\nnotify conspecifics of the presence of food.\nCalls given near food sources may also be used by\nheterospecific species, and this is especially true for\nspecies that often associate with other species. Willow Tits Poecile montanus often co-occur with other\nspecies of birds during the non-breeding season.\nThey produce calls upon discovering food sources at\nartificial feeders, thereby attracting conspecific and\nheterospecific individuals to the food site (Suzuki\n2012). Thus, calls produced by food-finding Willow\nTits function to facilitate the formation of mixed-\nspecies foraging flocks. Since individuals participat-\ning in mixed-species flocks may derive benefits from\nimproved feeding efficiency and/or reduced risk of\npredation (Morse 1977; Sridhar et al. 2009), this\ncommunication could provide an adaptive advantage\nfor both callers and receivers.\nProduction specificity in the acoustic structure of\nthe calls is necessary for the Willow Tits to attract\nother individuals to the discovered food source.\nHowever, whether and how they vocally discriminate\nbetween food and non-food contexts is unclear. Previous observations showed that calls given by food-\nfinding Willow Tits contain large numbers of tää\ncalls, which are strings of several tää notes (Suzuki\n2012). Tää calls can also be produced in combination\n(Received 27 June 2012; Accepted 6 October 2012)\n# E-mail: toshi.n.suzuki@gmail.com104\nT. N. SUZUKI\nwith other types of notes such as introductory and\nspitt notes, and Willow Tits use such combinatorial\ncalls in a variety of contexts (Haftorn 1993, 2000).\nTherefore, context-dependent variation in the note\ncomposition of calls may allow Willow Tits to\nincrease the amount of information they can convey.\nIn closely related species of parids, individuals\nmay use subtle variation in the note composition of\ntheir calls to encode different information. For example, several chickadees and titmice alter the note repetition rate of their “chick-a-dee” mobbing calls\naccording to predator size (Black-capped Chickadees\nPoecile atricapillus, Templeton et al. 2005; Carolina\nChickadees P. carolinensis, Soard and Ritchison\n2009; Tufted Titmice Baeolophus bicolor, Courter &\nRitchison 2010) and distance (Black-capped Chicka-\ndees, Baker & Becker 2002). Similarly, context-\ndependent variation in the note composition of calls\nmay serve to convey different information in a non-\nthreatened context. Gaddis (1985) noted that Moun-\ntain Chickadees P. gambeli may alter the note composition of their “chick-a-dee” calls when they arrive\nat and leave a foraging patch, suggesting that the\nchickadees may signal food sources to flock mem-\nbers. However, Gaddis (1985) did not consider indi-\nvidual differences in call structure. Since the acoustic\nstructure of combinatorial calls in parids may vary\namong individuals and flocks (Nowicki 1983), indi-\nvidual identification of birds is necessary to compare\ncall features.\nIn this study, I investigated whether the note composition of calls in Willow Tits varied depending on\nthe presence or absence of food sources. Calls produced by individually marked Willow Tits when dis-\ncovering supplies of sunflower seeds were compared\nwith those produced by the same individuals when\nmoving through their habitat in a non-food context.\nThis study complements earlier findings showing that\nthe Willow Tit’s tää calls function to facilitate the\nformation of mixed-species flocks (Suzuki 2012) and\nprovides one of the first steps toward assessing\nwhether birds can use subtle variation in the note\ncomposition of calls to discriminate between food\nand non-food contexts.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\n1) Study site and subjects\nThe study was conducted in a mixed forest in\nKaruizawa, Nagano, Japan (36°21 – 22’N, 138°35 –\n36’E), between January 26 and February 9, 2008.\nData were collected from 12 individual Willow Tits\nthat were distinguishable by a combination of color-\nbands. These birds were found in at least five conspe-\ncific flocks (two to five individuals per flock), but the\nmembers from different flocks were often observed\nto form a larger group. They frequently associated,\nduring the non-breeding season, with individuals of\nseveral other species of birds, such as: Long-tailed\nTit Aegithalos caudatus, Coal Tit Periparus ater,\nGreat Tits Parus major, Varied Tit Poecile varius,\nEurasian Nuthatch Sitta europaea, Japanese Pygmy\nWoodpecker Dendrocopos kizuki, Great Spotted\nWoodpecker D. major, and Japanese Green Woodpecker Picus awokera (T. N. Suzuki, personal obser-\nvation).\n2) Recording methods\nTo record calls produced upon the discovery of\nfood sources, a wooden feeder (25 cm × 25 cm × 5\ncm) was placed on the ground in a forest clearing and\nfilled with 300 g of sunflower seeds. This setup\nallowed all of the flock members to land on and take\nseeds from the feeder during each trial. Recordings\nbegan when Willow Tits came within 15 m of the\nfeeder and continued until approximately 10 min\nafter the first bird arrived, since their calling rate\ndecreased as flock members arrived and they often\nleft the food site within 10 min. During trials, observations/recordings were made from a distance of\n10 – 12 m from the feeder so as to identify individual\ncallers and record calls emitted by the food discoverers without disturbing them. No birds showed any\nescape flights and none gave alarm calls (zi calls;\nHaftorn 2000) to humans from this distance. From\none to four trials (separated by at least one hour)\nwere conducted each day, resulting in 36 trials over\n14 days. The location of the feeder was changed for\neach trial. This procedure ensured that only calls produced by individuals upon the discovery of new food\nsources were recorded.\nTo record calls produced in non-food contexts,\nWillow Tit flocks were followed through areas of the\nforest when no feeder was provided. After determining the individual identity of the birds, their vocaliza-\ntions were recorded from approximately 10 – 12 m\naway, with recording continuing until the birds flew\nout of sight. A total of 63 call series were recorded\nover nine days.\nRecordings were made using an LS370 parabolic\nmicrophone (Fuji Planning Co., Tokyo, Japan) con-\nnected to a Sony MZ-RH1 Hi-MD Walkman (sam-105\nCalls of food-finding Willow Tits\npling wave files at 44.1 kHz, 16 bits; Sony Co.,\nTokyo, Japan), in calm and dry weather conditions\nfrom 0800 to 1500 (Japan Standard Time).\n3) Call analyses\nA total of 1,579 calls was recorded (943 calls\n[mean±SD of 79 ± 57] in food contexts and 636 calls\n[mean±SD of 53 ± 34] in non-food contexts) from 12\ncolor-banded Willow Tits. Calls were analyzed by\nviewing sound spectrograms using Adobe Audition\n3.0 software (Adobe, San Jose, CA, USA). Strings of\nnotes with less than 0.25-s intervals were considered\nseparate calls. Based on a previous description\n(Haftorn 1993), three types of notes were determined\nfrom the recorded calls: introductory, spitt, and tää\nnotes (see Fig. 1). Several types of introductory notes\nmay be produced (Haftorn 1993), but distinguishing\nthe different note types from the recordings was dif-\nficult because they often contained heavy background\nnoise. Therefore, all notes other than spitt and tää\nnotes were categorized as introductory notes.\nThe following measurements were chosen to rep-\nresent the vocal behaviors of the Willow Tits. (1)\nNumber of notes per call: the average number of each\nnote type per call for each bird was measured. (2)\nPercentage of call types: calls were classified into six\ntypes following the sequence of different note types\n(introductory, spitt, tää, introductory-tää, spitt-tää,\nand introductory-spitt-tää) and then the percentage of\neach call type in the recorded calls for each bird was\ncalculated.\n4) Statistical analyses\nWilcoxon matched-pairs signed-rank tests were\nused to compare the note composition of calls (i.e.,\nthe number of notes per call and the percentage of\neach call type) between food and non-food contexts.\nExact tests were used because of the small sample\nsize (N = 12; Mundry & Fischer 1998). Since the\nanalyses involved multiple tests, significance levels\ncontrolled by using sequential Bonferroni adjust -\nments are reported. All statistical analyses were per-\nformed in R for Windows version 2.11.1 (R Develop-\nment Core Team 2010). All tests were two-tailed, and\nthe level of significance was primarily set as 0.05.\nRESULTS\nWillow Tits altered the note composition of their\ncalls between food and non-food contexts. The number of each note type per call varied between the two\ncontexts (Fig. 2a). Calls produced by birds in the\npresence of a feeder contained greater numbers of tää\nnotes (exact Wilcoxon signed-rank test: T + =77,\nties = 0, P < 0.001, α = 0.025) and smaller numbers of\nintroductory notes (T + =78, ties = 0, P < 0.001,\nα = 0.017) than those produced in non-food contexts.\nThere was no significant difference in the number of\nspitt notes per call between the two contexts (T +=11,\nties = 6, P = 1.0, α = 0.05).\nThe percentage of each call type in a call series\nalso differed significantly between food and non-food\ncontexts (Fig. 2b). Call series given near the feeder\ncontained a greater percentage of tää calls (T +=78,\nties = 0, P < 0.001, α = 0.008) and a lower percentage\nof introductory-tää calls (T + =78, ties = 0, P < 0.001,\nα = 0.008) than those given in non-food contexts.\nThere were no significant differences in the other\nfour call types between the two contexts (introduc-\ntory: T + =6, ties = 9, P = 0.25, α = 0.013; spitt: T+ =2,\nties = 10, P = 0.5, α = 0.017; spitt-tää: T+=10, ties=7,\nP = 0.63, α = 0.025; introductory-spitt-tää: T+ =0.5,\nties = 11, P = 1.0, α = 0.05).\nFig. 1. Three Willow Tit calls showing different note com-\npositions: (a) an introductory-tää call composed of two intro-\nductory notes followed by two tää notes; (b) a spitt-tää call\ncomposed of two spitt notes followed by two tää notes; and\n(c) a tää call composed of five tää notes.106\nT. N. SUZUKI\nDISCUSSION\nWillow Tits were found to alter the note composition of their calls depending on the presence or\nabsence of food sources. They typically produced tää\ncalls when arriving at newly discovered feeders,\nwhereas they typically produced introductory-tää\ncalls when moving through habitat without food sup-\nplies. Food-finding Willow Tits likely did not pro-\nduce tää calls as a fear response to a new feeder since\nthey produce tää calls even when accustomed to\nfeeders (Suzuki 2012). Rather, Willow Tits likely\naltered the note composition of their calls to recruit\nconspecifics to newly discovered food sources, since\nthey produce tää calls particularly when they arrive\nat feeders alone and the food discoverers produce\nmore calls than the followers (Suzuki 2012).\nPrevious research showed that playbacks of tää\ncalls attract more conspecific and heterospecific indi-\nviduals than those of introductory-tää calls (Suzuki\n2012). The research also showed an inverted relation-\nship between the calling rate of Willow Tits and the\nnumber of conspecific and heterospecific individuals\nat the food site (Suzuki 2012). Therefore, Willow Tits\nmay use subtle variation in the note composition of\ntheir calls to facilitate the formation of mixed-species\nforaging flocks. Previous studies on vocal communi-\ncation in other parids have also shown that calls with\ndifferent note composition can elicit different\nresponses, not only in conspecifics, but also in het-\nerospecifics. For example, Red-breasted Nuthatches\nSitta canadensis respond to variation in the “chick-a-\ndee” calls of Black-capped Chickadees, i.e., they are\nmore likely to approach the caller when the “chicka-dee” calls have greater numbers of dee notes than\nthose with smaller numbers of dee notes (Templeton\n& Greene 2007). Willow Tits altered both their note\ncombination and note repetition rate between food\nand non-food contexts. Further playback experiments\nusing vocalizations with artificially controlled acous-\ntic features are needed to reveal the exact mechanism\nfor intraspecific and interspecific recognition of Wil-\nlow Tit vocalizations.\nAlthough Willow Tits produced a high proportion\nof tää calls in a food context, tää calls are not specific\nto food contexts and are used in a variety of contexts\n(Haftorn 1993, 2000). For example, Willow Tits pro-\nduce tää calls when mobbing predators or when they\nare disturbed on their nests (Haftorn 1993; Toshitaka\nN. Suzuki unpublished data). The recruitment of\nother flock members should be a common response\nto calls produced in either a food or a mobbing con-\ntext, so tää calls may have a general recruitment\nfunction. The versatile use of harmonic note types\n(e.g., dee notes in “chick-a-dee” calls) in recruitment\ncontexts has been documented in several closely\nrelated species (e.g., Carolina Chickadees, Freeberg\n2008; Mahurin & Freeberg 2009; Soard & Ritchison\n2009), and the recruitment function of these note\ntypes may be phylogenetically conserved across species within the Paridae family.\nCalls produced in non-food contexts contained a\ngreater proportion of introductory-tää calls, compared\nwith those produced in the presence of food. Since\ncalls in non-food contexts were recorded mainly\nwhen Willow Tit flocks moved through the forest,\nintroductory notes might function to coordinate flock\ncohesion. However, introductory notes may include\nseveral different types of chevron notes (Haftorn\n1993), which might have different functions in com-\nmunication. Therefore, further detailed analyses of\nacoustic structure are required to test the role of\nintroductory notes.\nIn conclusion, this study reveals that Willow Tits\ndiscriminate between food and non-food contexts by\nFig. 2. Note composition of combinatorial calls of Willow\nTits (N = 12) in food (white) and non-food (gray) contexts: (a)\nnumber of each note type per call (introductory, spitt, and tää);\nand (b) percentage of calls within each call type (I: introduc-\ntory; S: spitt; T: tää). Box plots show medians (lines in the\nboxes), 25% and 75% quartiles (boxes), outermost values\nwithin the range of 1.5 times the respective quartiles (whis-\nkers), and outliers (circles).107\nCalls of food-finding Willow Tits\nusing subtle variation in the note composition of their\ncalls. Complementing earlier finding that tää calls\nattract more conspecific and heterospecific individu-\nals than introductory-tää calls (Suzuki 2012), this\nstudy demonstrates that Willow Tits alter the note\ncomposition of their calls to facilitate the formation\nof mixed-species flocks at a discovered food source.\nParids are leader species in mixed-species flocks\n(Morse 1977; Sridhar et al. 2009), so their calls may\nbe important in regulating the movement and cohe-\nsion of such flocks. However, despite the consider-\nable variation in call structure within and between\nParidae species (see Lucas & Freeberg 2007), we still\nknow little about the function of call variation. Future\nstudies on vocal communication in parids may clarify\nthe links between complexity in vocal systems, intra-\nspecific and interspecific recognition of complex sig-\nnals, and the ecological significance of communica-\ntion networks.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nI would like to thank Craig Barnett and Keisuke Ueda for\ncomments on an earlier version of the manuscript.

Animal vocalisations are generally considered to be holistic with few examples of utterances meaning something other than the sum of their parts. Previously, we have shown that\nmale putty-nosed monkeys produce call series consisting of two call types in response to different events.\nThey can also be combined into short sequences that convey a different message from those conveyed by\neither call type alone. Here, we investigate whether ‘pyow–hack’ sequences are compositional in that the\nindividual calls contribute to their overall meaning. However, the monkeys behaved as if they perceived\nthe sequence as an idiomatic expression rather than decoding the sequence. Nonetheless, while this communication system lacks the generative power of syntax it enables callers to increase the number of messages that can be conveyed by a small and innate call repertoire.\nÓ 2011 Elsevier Inc.

Introduction\nOne of the greatest challenges for theories of human evolution\nis to provide a coherent account of how language has emerged\nfrom more ancestral forms of communication and cognition, and\nhow this relates to animal communication. A hallmark of human\nlanguage is its sheer expressive power, which is particularly striking when contrasted to all known primate vocal communication\nsystems that are characterised by species-specific and highly restricted repertoires of calls. A widely held assumption is that syntax has emerged ‘de novo’, without any relevant precursors before\nhumans diverged from the rest of the primates some six million\nyears ago (e.g., Tallerman, 2005). Many animals produce monomorphic series of calls, and in some cases there is evidence that\nvariations in series length are semantically meaningful features\nfor listeners (e.g., Schel, Candiotti, & Zuberbühler, 2010; Stephan\n& Zuberbühler, 2008). Especially interesting examples are species\nthat produce series composed of multiple call types in higher order\nstructures. The most complex of these include the songs of some\nbird species (e.g., Catchpole & Slater, 1995; Gentner, Fenn, Margoliash, & Nusbaum, 2006; Marler & Slabbekoorn, 2004) and humpback whales (Payne & McVay, 1971; Suzuki, Buck, & Tyack,\n2006). However, Hurford (2009) has argued that, unlike human\nlanguage, the number of sequences is never larger than the number\nof elements that make them up. Equally important, there is no evidence that these combinations are semantically compositional.\nRather, like simple, single-call utterances, they convey information\nabout whole situations. Regarding their biological function, these\nutterances are sexually selected signals with the sole purpose of\nadvertising territory ownership or the caller’s competitive ability\nand suitability as a mating partner (Catchpole & Slater, 1995; Marler & Slabbekoorn, 2004; Tyack, 1981).\nWithin primates, the duet songs of some pair-bonded species,\nsuch as gibbons or titi monkeys, show significant complexity in\nterms of the number of call types they contain, with some indications that their organisation might be rule-based (Cäsar, Byrne,\nYoung, & Zuberbühler, submitted for publication; Mitani & Marler,\n1989; Robinson, 1984). Similar to bird song, this type of vocal\nbehaviour appears to carry little meaning apart from advertising\nthe presence of a bonded pair of residents to potential intruders\nand territorial neighbours. An interesting exception is the lar gibbons (Hylobates lar) that use their songs not only to advertise territory ownership but also in predator defence. Predator songs are\nmade from the same basic song units as the more common duet\nsongs, although the units are assembled in different ways (Clarke,\nReichard, & Zuberbühler, 2006).\nWhether the production of multiple calls is a strategy to generate redundancy (e.g., to increase the likelihood of successful perception) or to overcome the constraints of small signal\nrepertoires is unknown for most species. For example, chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) produce combinations of calls, and it has\nbeen suggested that some of them are linked to specific contexts\n(Crockford & Boesch, 2005), but more systematic work is required\nto test this hypothesis. There are some cases in which calls appear\nto act as contextual modifiers of others. Tamarins (Sanguinus oedipus) and capuchin monkeys (Cebus olivaceus), for example, produce\ncombined utterances of alert and alarm calls, but as far as semantics are concerned, combining these calls seems to simply average\nthe meaning of constituent calls (Robinson, 1984; Cleveland &\n0093-934X/$ - see front matter Ó 2011 Elsevier Inc.

In Campbell’s monkeys (Cercopithecus campbelli),\ncall sequences introduced by low-frequency ‘boom’ calls have been\nassociated with a range of disturbances that do not involve the direct presence of a predator (Ouattara, Lemasson, & Zuberbühler,\n2009a). In one playback experiment, boom calls were artificially\nadded to two different alarm call series given to leopards and\ncrowned eagles, respectively. This manipulation had significant effects on how listeners interpreted the meaning of the predatorspecific alarm calls (Zuberbühler, 2002). In another study, it was\nshown that Campbell’s monkeys produced additional acoustic variation by adding an invariant, suffixed, vocal unit to the basic alarm\ncall types, which transformed them from predator-specific alarm\ncalls to more generalised alarm calls (Ouattara, Lemasson, &\nZuberbühler, 2009b). In sum, like animal songs, stereotypical call\ncombinations occur in a number of primate species and it has been\nargued that this behaviour shows some parallels with phonemic\ncombinations in human speech (Yip, 2006).\nWhile such syntax-like signal production appears to be relatively infrequent, even in non-human primates, this is not the case\nfor the perception of syntactically organised signals. In field experiments with Chacma baboons (Papio cynocephalus) listeners made\nsocial inferences when overhearing call exchanges between familiar group members. During social interactions, baboons produce\nspecific vocalisations that reflect their relative rank (grunts, fear\nbarks). In playback experiments, listeners responded weakly to\nsimulated social interactions that complied with the social dominance hierarchy of the group (e.g., a dominant’s grunts followed\nby a subordinate’s fear barks; Cheney, Seyfarth, & Silk, 1995). If\nthe sequence was reversed, so that listeners heard a subordinate’s\ngrunts followed by a dominant’s fear barks, they responded\nstrongly, especially if it involved members of different matrilines\n(Bergman, Beehner, Cheney, & Seyfarth, 2003). This suggests that\nbaboons interpret vocal exchanges of others by taking into account\nthe callers’ relative social positions, which enables them to respond\nto simulated rank reversals. Similar findings have recently been reported for chimpanzees. Here, if listeners heard a low-ranking individual giving aggressor screams followed by victim screams of a\nhigher-ranking one, they showed significantly more interest than\nto the reverse order (Slocombe, Kaller, Call, & Zuberbühler, 2010).\nOverall, these data suggest that non-human primates, and perhaps\nmany other social animals, extract meaning by attending to sequences of signals given by multiple individuals. Whether or not\nlisteners recruit the same cognitive processes when interpreting\ncall sequences given by the same individual is an open question.\nDuring call exchanges between individuals, the meaning of individual calls remains largely unchanged (e.g., a ‘fear bark’ always\nindicates a socially subordinate caller). In contrast, in Campbell’s\nmonkey call sequences, the semantic content of individual calls appears to be mainly determined by their presence in a particular sequence (e.g., Ouattara et al., 2009a).\nIn this study, we address this issue by focussing on the semantic\ncontent of call combinations produced by putty-nosed monkeys.\nLike other guenon species, adult males’ have a small repertoire of\nloud-calls, which carry over large distances and function in both\nintra- and intergroup communication. Two acoustically distinct\nloud call types ‘pyows’ and ‘hacks’ (Arnold & Zuberbühler,\n2006a), are generally given as part of longer call series: ‘pyow’ series, ‘hack’ series, and ‘transitional’ series (a series of ‘hacks’ followed by a series of ‘pyows’). These three series are given to a\nwide range of external events and there is evidence that listeners\nrequire contextual information to infer of the cause of the calls (Arnold & Zuberbühler, submitted for publication). However, ‘pyows’\nand ‘hacks’ are also concatenated into short ‘pyow–hack’ (P–H) sequences that elicit a very different response from those elicited by\nany of the call series, i.e. they induce travel of the entire group\n(Fig. 1a; Arnold & Zuberbühler, 2006b, 2008). P–H sequences can\nbe produced alone or inserted within any of the call series described above. In the latter case, they are distinguishable by significant pauses or by a transition back to ‘pyows’ (Fig. 1b).\nWhile ‘pyow’, ‘hack’ or ‘transitional’ series resulted in increased\nvigilance or anti-predator behaviour, P–H sequences reliably elicited group travel without the need for additional contextual information. In a field experiment, we showed that call order, not\nvariations in acoustic structure of the constituent calls, governed listeners’ responses (Arnold & Zuberbühler, 2008). In putty-nosed\nmonkeys, therefore, listeners attribute different meanings to the call\nstrings, according to the different combinations of two call types.\nThe P–H call sequence provides a unique opportunity to explore\nwhether animal call combinations approximate linguistic syntax\nbeyond the phonological level (sensu Yip, 2006) for the following\nreason. Although P–H sequences are always short, the composition\nof the sequence varies significantly in terms of the number (between two and seven calls) and proportion (e.g., P P P P H vs. P H\nH H H) of its constituent calls.\nIn order to determine whether these compositional differences\nalso differed in their semantic content, we carried out a field experiment in which we presented P–H sequences of different lengths\nand composition to females in a habituated group. If the P–H sequence is compositional, and the information conveyed by the\noverall sequence depends upon the relative contribution of each\ncall type, then listeners should attend to the number of ‘hacks’\nand ‘pyows’ in each sequence and respond differently. In previous\nwork, we have show that ‘pyow’ series predominately cause listeners to orient their attention towards the caller, sometimes accompanied with some approach, while ‘hacks’ predominantly increase\nvigilance and inhibit movement (Arnold & Zuberbühler, 2008, submitted for publication). We thus predicted that P–H sequences\ncomposed of a large proportion of ‘hacks’ would result in significantly delayed travel over shorter distances compared to sequences containing a higher proportion of ‘pyows’.\n2. Methods\n2.1. Study site and subjects\nField experiments were conducted in Gashaka Gumti National\nPark, Nigeria, between November 2008 and May 2009 by KA together with two field assistants. The study area consisted of a mosaic of primary semi-deciduous lowland rainforest and grassland\nnear the village of Gashaka (7°200N, 11°300E). Putty-nosed monkeys live in one-male groups of up to 20 individuals, with 6–9 adult\nfemales and their offspring. Group density in the area has been\nestimated at 3–4 groups per km2 (Dunn, 1993). One group of\nputty-nosed monkeys, which comprised one adult male, seven females and eight immature individuals during the period of study,\nhad been followed on a daily basis since June 2007 and was habituated to human presence.\n2.2. Adult male calls\nMale putty nosed monkeys regularly produce two different\nkinds of loud calls, ‘hacks’ and ‘pyows’ (Struhsaker, 1970; Gautier-Hion, Colyn, & Gautier, 1999; Eckardt & Zuberbühler, 2004; Arnold & Zuberbühler, 2006a). Both vocalisations are loud and\nconspicuous, discrete call types that carry over one kilometre and\ncan be distinguished by ear. Statistical analyses differentiating\nthe acoustic structure of these call types have been presented elsewhere (Arnold & Zuberbühler, 2006a). ‘Pyows’ are individually distinctive and their acoustic structure differs subtly from male to\nmale; ‘hacks’ on the other hand are not (Price, Arnold, Zuberbühler,\n& Semple, 2009).\n304 K. Arnold, K. Zuberbühler / Brain & Language 120 (2012) 303–3092.3. Experimental protocol\nFrom an extensive library of recordings of calls given by the\ngroup male we selected natural ‘pyow–hack’ sequences of different\nlengths and composition and edited them where necessary to control for overall length, using the software Cool Edit Pro 2.1 (Syntrillium Software), to produce the experimental stimuli. Stimuli\nconsisting of six calls were of approximately the same duration.\nThe stimuli consisting of two calls were necessarily shorter. We\nused only recordings of the group male’s calls as ‘pyows’ are individually distinctive (Price et al., 2009) and the broadcasting of the\ncalls of another male at close proximity to the group would have\nbeen likely to affect subjects’ responses. Before each trial, the location of the male was established and his behaviour monitored by a\nfield assistant throughout the trial. As soon as the male moved to\nthe periphery of the group the experimenter selected one adult female, who was at least 50 m from the adult male, thus ensuring\nthat she did not have the opportunity to observe his behaviour. A\nsecondary requirement was that the focal subject was out of visual\ncontact with other females to ensure that any subsequent behaviour was not guided by nearby individuals. Using walkie-talkies,\na second field assistant was directed to a suitable location, where\nhe set up the playback equipment consisting of a NAGRA DSM\nplayback speaker connected to a portable CD player (Fig. 2).\nPlayback from this position ensured that the direction from\nwhich the female heard the stimulus was consistent with the\nknown location of the male, and that other individuals within\nthe group were not able to observe the equipment setup and learn\nthe association between the equipment and the stimulus. Once the\nequipment was in place, one of the four stimulus types was broadcast and the locomotor behaviour of the target female was monitored for the next 20 min. Her initial position was read off a GPS\nunit at the time of the stimulus broadcast and at the end of the\n20 min monitoring period to the nearest metre. The time that the\nsubject began to move was also recorded.\nThe experiments were based on a within-subject design. On different days, one of the six known female subjects heard one of four\nplayback sequences consisting of P–H sequences of different\nlengths and composition: (a) P–H–H–H–H–H, (b) P–P–P–H–H–H,\nor (c) P–P–P–P–P–H, (d) P–H. We conducted these 24 trials\n(6 \u0002 4) in a randomised order. Trials were carried out at different\ntimes of the day and not more than once every 3 days. Trials were\nabandoned if the equipment setup was observed or if the group\nmale responded with his own calls. Our dependent variables were\nthe distance travelled during the next 20 min and the latency to\ntravel following each playback stimulus.\n2.4. Naturalistic observations\nObservations of whole group responses to naturally occurring\nP–H sequences were also included in order to ensure that the results of the playback study were representative of natural behaviour. These data only include a measure of the distance travelled.\nLatency to travel was too difficult to determine accurately under\nnatural conditions. For this purpose, a single habituated group of\nputty-nosed monkeys was followed for a total of 30 days between\nJanuary and June 2005. Once located, the position of the estimated\ncentre of mass of the group was recorded using a GPS unit. The\ngroup location was then recorded at 15-min intervals thereafter\nin order to determine the distance travelled. If the male produced\nloud calls, a field assistant recorded the group’s location, while KA\nrecorded the sequence of calls, together with time that calling began. From that point on, the estimated centre of mass of the group\nwas again recorded at 15-min intervals. Distance travelled was calculated for each uninterrupted 45-min block.\n2.5. Statistical analysis\nWe conducted Friedman tests to compare the distance travelled\nand latency to travel following playbacks of differently composed\nP–H sequences. Where the results of Friedman tests were significant, we conducted exact Wilcoxon signed ranks post hoc tests\nin order to identify where significant differences lay. The relationship between the distance travelled and the composition of naturally occurring P–H sequences was investigated using Spearman’s\nrank correlations. All tests were two-tailed with a set at 0.05 except for post hoc comparisons. In these cases a Bonferroni correction was applied resulting in a = 0.017 (0.05/3). Our second\nanalysis strategy was to test the data with a generalised linear\nmixed model (GLMM). All analyses were carried out on SPSS 17.\n(a)\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n0 1 2 3 4 5 6\nTime (s)\nFrequency (kHz)\n(b) P P H H H -* P P P P P P P P P P\nH H H H H -- P P H H H -- H H H\nH H H H H -- P P H H H -* P P P\nFig. 1.

Zuberbühler / Brain & Language 120 (2012) 303–309 3053. Results\nWe first analysed the distance travelled by entire groups, following naturally occurring P–H sequences. We recorded group\nmovement after N = 29 instances of the male producing P–H sequences of various compositions. On N = 3 occasions the male produced two separate P–H sequences, one after the other. These\nobservations were discarded from the analyses. The remaining\nN = 26 observations were P–H sequences of between two and seven calls and of variable composition.\nNeither the absolute number of ‘hacks’, nor the proportion of\n‘hacks’ in the P–H sequence resulted in systematic variations in\nthe distance travelled (Spearman rank order correlation coefficient\ntests: number of ‘hacks’, N = 26, rs = 0.160, p = 0.435; proportion of\n‘hacks’, N = 26, rs = \u00040.123, p = 0.548). However, there were indications of a positive relationship between the number of ‘pyows’ in a\nP–H sequence and the distance travelled by the group (N = 26,\nrs = 0.359, p = 0.072; Fig. 3a) as well as the total number of calls\nof the sequence and the distance travelled (N = 26, rs = 0.318,\np = 0.114; Fig. 3b).\nMales usually produced just one P–H sequence per occasion\nalthough sometimes they gave two (N = 3), one after the other, as\nindicated earlier. We found that the group moved significantly further following two P–H sequences than one (Mann–Whitney U\ntest: N1 = 26, N2 = 3, U = 11.5, p = 0.049).\nAlthough these observational results indicate that the number\nof ‘pyows’ per sequence is related to increased travel distance, this\nfinding may be confounded by the sheer number of calls per sequence. In subsequent playback experiments, we addressed this\npotential confound by presenting short (2-call) or long (6-call) sequences with varying composition. Listeners usually responded to\nplaybacks of different P–H sequences by moving towards the\nsource of the calls. We found that the distance travelled differed\naccording to the sequence type (median distance travelled following playbacks of PH = 9.5 m, PPPHHH = 28.5 m, PHHHHH = 22.5 m,\nPPPPPH = 24.0 m; NPH = NPPPHHH = NPHHHHH = NPPPPPH = 6; df = 1,\nv2 = 8.4, p < 0.001; Friedman analysis of variance; Fig. 4a). However, post hoc tests revealed that this difference was due to listeners’ travelling shorter distances after hearing the short compared\nto the long P–H sequences (PH vs. PPPHHH, z = \u00042.201, p = 0.031;\nPH vs. PHHHHH, z = \u00042.201, p = 0.031; PH vs. PPPPPH, z = \u00041.992,\np = 0.063; Wilcoxon signed ranks tests). Additional post hoc comparisons within the long P–H sequences indicated that differences\nSpeaker location\nMale Target female\n25 m >50 m\nFig. 2.

The observer stayed with the target female and measured her\nlocomotor response to the playback stimulus.\nFig. 3.

Zuberbühler / Brain & Language 120 (2012) 303–309in composition, expressed in terms of the proportion of ‘pyows’\nand ‘hacks’ within the sequence, had no effect on the distance travelled (PPPHHH vs. PHHHHH, z = \u00041.153, p = 0.313; PPPHHH vs.\nPPPPPH, z = \u00040.526, p = 0.656; PPPPPH vs. PHHHHH, z = \u00040.105,\np = 1; Wilcoxon signed rank tests).\nOur second analysis strategy was based on testing the data with\na GLMM to determine whether distance travelled might be affected\nby an interaction between sequence length and the proportions of\neach call type within the sequence. However, this was not possible\nsince there was no variance in the proportion of ‘pyows’ and ‘hacks’\nin 2-call sequences. The main effects, however, were very much in\nline with the findings reported above (sequence length:\nF(1, 21) = 8.942; p < 0.01; proportion of pyows: F(1, 21) = 0.301;\np > 0.58).\nIn terms of the latency to move, we also found differences\naccording to the composition of the sequence (median latency following playbacks of PH = 291s, PPPHHH = 114s, PHHHHH = 170s,\nPPPPPH = 159s. Friedman analysis of variance: NPH = NPPPHHH =\nNPHHHHH = NPPPPPH = 6, df = 1, v2 = 20.16, p < 0.001; Fig. 4b). However, none of the post hoc tests indicated a significant difference\nbetween P–H sequence types (Wilcoxon signed ranks test: PH vs.\nPPPHH, z = \u00041.472, p = 0.188; PH vs. PHHHHH, z = \u00040.524,\np = 0.688; PH vs. PPPPPH, z = \u00041.572, p = 0.156; PPPHHH vs.\nPHHHHH, z = \u00040.943, p = 0.438; PPPHHH vs. PPPPPH, z = \u00040.943,\np = 0.438; PPPPPH vs. PHHHHH, z = \u00040.105, p = 1).\n4. Discussion\nOur goal was to explore the possibility that an animal call combination may approximate linguistic syntax beyond the phonological level. One major objection is that it is difficult to assign\nmeaning in any relevant conceptual sense to the male putty-nosed\nmonkeys’ calls since their use is rather broad, especially in the case\nof ‘pyows’. Another is that the simple rule observed in putty-nosed\nmonkey calls is a one-off and is not applied to other call types or\nother combinations. For example, there appears to be little difference, in either usage or response, between a series of ‘hacks’ and\na ‘transitional’ series that begins with ‘hacks’ and ‘ends’ with\n‘pyows’ (Arnold, Pohlner, & Zuberbühler, 2010). Nonetheless, it is\npossible that the two different call types that make up the sequence contribute to its overall meaning. In previous research we\nhave shown that both ‘pyows’ and ‘hacks’ increase vigilance and\norienting properties towards the caller. The two call types differ\nmost strongly in the observed locomotor responses of listeners:\nwhile ‘hacks’ tend to inhibit movement (probably because they\nindicate eagle presence), ‘pyows’ tend to trigger movement towards the caller (probably to obtain additional cues about his gaze\ndirection) (Arnold & Zuberbühler, submitted for publication). If\nmonkeys attended to the compositional features of P–H sequences,\nthen the degree of movement should have been correlated with the\nnumber of ‘pyows’ and ‘hacks’ in the sequence in either absolute or\nrelative terms. Alternatively, listeners may simply learn that this\nparticular, and fairly stereotypical, combination is associated with\nmovement and need not unpack the message into its constituent\nelements. Our experimental results are consistent with the second\nhypothesis (Fig. 3).\nWhile it is difficult to define precisely what ‘pyows’ and ‘hacks’\nmight mean, they do appear to have distinct functions when given\nalone or in series; series of ‘hacks’ are alarm calls associated with\nsituations involving high urgency, particularly eagle attacks, while\nseries of ‘pyows’ appear to function as attention-getters and are given in a wide variety of contexts (Arnold, Pohlner, & Zuberbühler,\n2008; Arnold & Zuberbühler, 2006a, submitted for publication). If\ntaken out of their native series and produced as part of a P–H sequence, do these two call types continue to contribute their native\nmeaning or do they enter the sequence as semantically blank\nslates? We found two major effects that were relevant to this\nquestion.\nFirstly and most importantly, the composition of the sequence\n(i.e. the proportion of ‘pyows’ and ‘hacks’ it contained) had no significant effect on listeners’ responses for sequences with the same\nnumber of calls (Fig. 3). Under natural conditions, there was a tendency for the whole group to travel further after the male gave a P–\nH sequence, which contained a larger number of pyows, although\nthis may have been confounded by the number of calls per sequence (Fig. 4).\nSecond, longer sequences resulted in larger distances being covered by listeners than shorter sequences. This effect was significant\nwhen comparing responses to experimental sequences consisting of\ntwo vs. six calls, regardless of composition (Fig. 3). Observations of\nwhole group responses to sequences given under natural conditions\nshowed a trend in the same direction (Fig. 4b), although the small\nsample size prevented meaningful conclusions. A relevant finding\nis that the few examples of the male repeating the sequence did result in significantly stronger responses. Overall, and like many animal communication systems, it appears that longer signals result\nin stronger responses, perhaps because they are easier to detect.\nIt may be noted that the distances travelled by females in response to playbacks were much shorter than those measured after\n(a) Distance travelled\n(b) Latency to travel\nTime (s)\nFig. 4. The effect of different compositions of the P–H sequence on (a) the distance\ntravelled, and (b) the latency to travel during the 20 mins following playbacks.\nK. Arnold, K. Zuberbühler / Brain & Language 120 (2012) 303–309 307naturally occurring P–H sequences. However, this is not surprising\nsince, in natural situations, the male often leads a group progression after having instigated it with his vocal signals and females\nthat are out of visual range of the male move in the direction of\nthe call and eventually see the direction of travel taken by the rest\nof the group and follow them. However, in playback situations, the\nmale had not called and remained in the same location. Playbacks,\nunsurprisingly, did not result in whole group travel. Focal females,\nhowever, were always out of visual range of the male and, as far as\nwe could tell, other females. On hearing the male’s calls they would\nbegin to move in his apparent direction but generally stopped once\nthey saw that other members of the group were not moving, hence\nthe shorter observed travel distances.\nA common strategy for signal identification and localisation is\nsensitivity to two or more spectral or temporal components (e.g.,\nCapranica, 1965; Knudsen & Konishi, 1979). For example, tamarin\nmonkeys respond to long calls containing two call types more\nreadily than either call type alone. This has led to the hypothesis\nthat nonlinear responses of neurons to combined signals, compared with linear responses to the individual elements, may underlie this behavioural selectivity (Ghazanfar, Flombaum, Miller, &\nHauser, 2001). A further predication was that the central auditory\nsystem of species with long multi-syllabic vocal utterances contains more combination-sensitive neurons than other species,\nespecially if the units of perception are combinations of calls or syllables. In the present case, longer P–H sequences may simply be\neasier to identify than shorter ones and are consequently responded to more readily.\nThere are some parallels between this communication system\nand the ‘waggle dance’ of honeybees, often regarded as one of\nthe most complex examples of signal combinations. Foragers\nreturning to the hive perform a dance, the angle of which, relative\nto the upward direction on the comb, indicates the direction of the\nfood source relative to the sun. At the same time, the duration of\neach dance run is correlated with the distance to the food source\n(von Frisch, 1967; review by Dyer, 2002). Like the P–H sequence\nthe ‘intensity’ of the signal (i.e. its duration) provides information\nabout distance. However, there are also important differences. Different components of the bee dance encode different types of information (distance and direction) about past foraging events while\nthe putty-nosed monkeys’ P–H sequences refer to future behaviour. They signal the intention to move, and perhaps encode something about the intended distance, although in a more holistic way.\n4.1. Linguistic analogies\nTo conclude, our results suggest that the P–H sequence is not\ncompositional in any linguistic sense and if any parallel with human language can be drawn at all, it is with idiomatic phrases such\nas ‘‘kick the bucket’’, in which the meaning of the expression is not\nderived from the meaning of its constituent words but must be\nlearned as a convention. ‘Pyows’ and ‘hacks’ in the context of a\nP–H sequence resemble free morphemes that have become affixed\nto each other and merged into a semantic unit (Saeed, 2003).\nIf this description is correct then this unique example of a\nmeaningful animal call combination represents something of a\nsyntactic dead end. There is no reason, in principle, why other distinctive combinations of pyows and hacks could not be used to\nconvey other messages. So why is such potential not seized upon\nby natural selection (e.g., Novak, Plotkin, & Jansen, 2000)? It is unlikely that constraints are imposed by the ability of listeners to\nlearn new sequences since the capacity to learn serial order and\nstructural regularities within sequences has been demonstrated\nin non-human primates and birds (e.g., Endress, Carden, Versace,\n& Hauser, 2010; Gentner et al., 2006; Orlov, Amit, Yakovlev, Zohary, & Hochstein, 2006; Treichler, Raghanti, & Tilburg, 2003; Chen,\nSwartz, & Terrace, 1997). And the fact that listeners do not react to\nthe ‘hacks’ within the series as they would when functioning as\nalarm calls indicates that they are able to dissociate calls from their\nusual function when given in the context of a particular sequence\nof calls. More complex communication, including the ability to\ninnovate and link additional new sequences to specific contexts,\nmay not be favoured by natural selection, assuming that the existing vocal repertoire of these monkeys is sufficient to deal with the\nmain ecological and social challenges encountered by them. Our\nstudy also challenges the assumption that compound semantic\nunits should arise as a solution to the problem of an increasingly\nunwieldy or poorly differentiated vocabulary of single phonemes\n(Jackendoff, 1999) since this male loud call repertoire of only two\ncalls is the absolute minimum requirement for a combinatorial\nsystem to get off the ground. Hence, the constraints imposed by\na small repertoire of calls may in fact have favoured the evolution\nof call combinations where a larger repertoire of signals offered an\nevolutionary advantage.\nAcknowledgments\nWe thank the Nigerian National Park Services for granting permission to conduct research in Gashaka Gumti National Park and\nthe Nigerian Conservation Foundation for help with logistics.

Evidence for vocal\nflexibility is generally rare and typically restricted to acoustic\nvariants within the main call types or sequential production\nof multiple calls. So far, evidence for context-specific call\nsequences has been mainly in relation to external disturbances, particularly predation. In this study, we investigated\nextensively the vocal behaviour of free-ranging and individually identified Diana monkeys in non-predatory contexts. We found that adult females produced four vocal\nstructures alone (‘H’, ‘L’, ‘R’ and ‘A’ calls, the latter consisting of two subtypes) or combined in non-random ways\n(‘HA’, ‘LA’ and ‘RA’ call combinations) in relation to\nongoing behaviour or external events. Specifically, the\nconcatenation of an introductory call with the most\nfrequently emitted and contextually neutral ‘A’ call seems to\nfunction as a contextual refiner of this potential individual\nidentifier. Our results demonstrate that some non-human\nprimates are able to increase the effective size of their small\nvocal repertoire not only by varying the acoustic structure of\nbasic call types but also by combining them into more\ncomplex structures. We have demonstrated this phenomenon\nfor a category of vocalisations with a purely social function\nand discuss the implications of these findings for evolutionary theories of primate vocal communication.\nKeywords Social calls  Call combination\nVocal flexibility  Non-human primates\nIntroduction\nOne widespread mechanism of increasing acoustic flexibility in animal communication is to concatenate sounds\ninto more complex vocal sequences. This phenomenon is\ncommon in songbirds and other species that produce\nutterances composed of a series of notes or ‘syllables’ (e.g.\nPasseri: Catchpole and Slater 1995, quacking frog Crinia\ngeorgiana: Gerhardt et al. 2000, Humpback whales:\nMegaptera novaeangliae: Payne and McVay 1971).\nAlthough there have been repeated efforts to compare such\nanimal communication systems with syntax in human\nlanguage (e.g. Marler 1977), the gulf has remained vast\nwith major differences in terms of generativity and\nsemanticity (Chomsky 1981; Hauser et al. 2002). For\nexample, animal syntax is typically based on elements with\nlittle or no independent meaning that could be linked to\nthe organisational principles of the sequence. Moreover,\nthere is no clear evidence for generative use of sound\ncombinations, and as a consequence, the debate on the\nA. Candiotti  A.

The mainstream hypothesis\nhere is that human speech has emerged as an evolutionary\nderivative of a gesture-based communication system, with\na subsequent transition from the visual to the vocal domain\n(Corballis 2003). One alternative view is that ancestral\nhumans initially relied on a primate-like vocal communication system, perhaps complemented by gestural signals,\nbut then experienced an evolutionary process of gaining\nincreasing motor control over their vocal apparatus, which\neventually enabled them to imitate sound patterns and\nproduce arbitrary vocal patterns (e.g. Enard et al. 2002).\nSocial complexity may have favoured this process (Dunbar\n1998). One prediction of the vocal transition hypothesis\ntherefore is that enhanced acoustic flexibility should be\nfound, to various degrees, in primate call types that are\nprimarily used while interacting socially.\nThere are a growing number of primate studies that have\ndemonstrated acoustic flexibility within some of the species-specific (i.e. ‘genetically’ predetermined) call types\n(Cebuella pygmaea: Elowson and Snowdon 1994; Snowdon\nand Elowson 1999; Macaca fuscata: Koda et al. 2008;\nPapio anubis: Ey et al. 2009; Cercopithecus campbelli:\nLemasson and Hausberger 2004; Pan troglodytes: Slocombe\net al. 2010). A second source of acoustic flexibility is in the\nform of combinations of existing calls (P. troglodytes:\nCrockford and Boesch 2005; Pan paniscus: Clay and\nZuberbu¨hler 2009; Hylobates lar: Clarke et al. 2006;\nColobus guereza: Schel et al. 2009; Cercopithecus nictitans: Arnold and Zuberbu¨hler 2006; C. campbelli: Ouattara\net al. 2009a, b; Sanguinus oedipus: Cleveland and Snowdon\n1982; Cebus olivaceus: Robinson 1984) with evidence that\nsome of these sequences can be ‘meaningful’ to others\n(C. nictitans: Arnold and Zuberbu¨hler 2008; Cercopithecus\ndiana: Zuberbu¨hler 2002; C. guereza: Schel et al. 2010;\nP. paniscus: Clay and Zuberbu¨hler 2011).\nOne drawback is that studies of call combinations in\nprimates have focused on long-distance communication or\ncalls to predators. For example, male putty-nosed monkeys\n(C. nictitans) combine two types of loud calls into\nsequences that reliably predict forthcoming group progression (Arnold and Zuberbu¨hler 2008). Similarly, male\nCampbell’s monkeys (C. campbelli) transform highly specific alarm calls into general alert calls by an affixation\nmechanism (Ouattara et al. 2009a) and concatenate individual calls into sequences that are context-specific and\nrelated to external events (Ouattara et al. 2009b). However,\na largely unaddressed question is whether close-range social\ncalls in primates show similar or even increased flexibility\nin terms of acoustic properties and sequential structure, as\nhypothesised by Lemasson and Hausberger (2011).\nMany primate species produce short-distance social\ncalls, usually referred to as ‘clear calls’ or ‘contact calls’\n(e.g. Uster and Zuberbu¨hler 2001). They tend to be\namongst the most frequently emitted calls of the vocal\nrepertoire and can encode information on the caller’s\nidentity, social affinities, or spatial positioning (Harcourt\nand Stewart 1996; Gautier-Hion 1988; Lemasson and\nHausberger 2004, 2011). For example, Seyfarth and Cheney\n(1984) showed that vervet monkeys give acoustically distinct grunts in different social contexts, such as when\napproaching a dominant or subordinate group member, and\nthat these acoustic differences are ‘meaningful’ to conspecifics. In terms of acoustic flexibility, various studies\nhave found subtle contact call subtypes, and in some cases,\nthere is evidence for semantic content [e.g. Japanese\nmacaque ‘coo’ calls: Green 1975; Pygmy marmoset ‘trill’\ncalls: Pola and Snowdon 1975; Baboon ‘grunts’: Owren\net al. 1997; Campbell’s monkey ‘CH’ calls: Lemasson\net al. 2004; Lemasson and Hausberger 2011; review by\nSnowdon (2009)]. Further evidence for socially determined\nacoustic flexibility is in the form of converging acoustic\nstructure of contact calls between affiliated females\n(Pygmy marmosets: Snowdon and Elowson 1999; Campbell’s\nmonkeys: Lemasson and Hausberger 2004, Lemasson et al.\n2005). Here, we define ‘social’ calls broadly as vocalisations\nto communicate with other group members over short distances in non-predatory contexts.\nTo address this possibility that primate social calls also\nhave combinatorial properties, we carried out a study on\nwild Diana monkeys, Cercopithecus diana diana, a guenon\nspecies closely related to Campbell’s and putty-nosed\nmonkeys (Gautier 1988). Although Diana monkeys’ alarm\ncalls have been extensively studied (Zuberbu¨hler et al.\n1997, 1999; Zuberbu¨hler 2000a, b), little attention has been\npaid to females’ other types of vocalisations (Gautier 1988;\nHill 1994; Zuberbu¨hler et al. 1997; Uster and Zuberbu¨hler\n2001). This was partly due to the difficulties in identifying\nand describing these animals’ behaviour in detail, because\nthey spend much of their time in the upper forest canopy\n(McGraw 2007). Unlike savannah-dwelling primates, forest guenons are often out of sight from each other. Social\ninteractions are much less common because they spend\nmore effort monitoring each other’s behaviour and\nadjusting their own spatial position accordingly (Rowell\nand Olson 1983; Rowell 1988). Instead, guenons typically\nemit social calls to overcome the constraints of poor visibility in the forest and maintain group cohesion (e.g.\nGautier and Gautier 1977; Uster and Zuberbu¨hler 2001).\nCalling tends to be contagious, and call rates are increased\nwhen visibility is poor. Still, the specific contexts of\nemission of these social calls remain unknown. It is hence\n328 Anim Cogn (2012) 15:327–339\n123\nboth interesting and challenging to try and better understand these females’ social communicative system.\nWe were interested in the influence of social and environmental factors on the acoustic structure of female Diana\nmonkey’s vocalisations at several organisational levels of\ntheir repertoire. Given the complexity of their alarm calling\nsystem and the importance of indirect social interactions\nvia vocal communication, we hypothesised that their social\ncalls contained similar or even greater levels of acoustic\ndiversity in relation to contextual variables.\nMethods\nStudy site and subjects\nData were collected from February to May 2009 and\nfrom January to June 2010 from two groups (DIA1 and\nDIA2) of free-ranging Diana monkeys (C. diana diana)\nin Taı¨ National Park, Ivory Coast. The study area is\nlocated in the south-western part of the park, adjacent to\nthe CRE (Centre de Recherche en Ecologie) research\nstation (5500\nN, 7210\nW). Both groups had been under\nobservation since the early 1990s and were fully habituated to the presence of human observers. Both groups\nconsisted of about 20–25 individuals, including one adult\nmale, 9–10 adult females (individuals with visible nipples\nand at least one offspring), several sub-adults, juveniles and\ninfants.\nData collection\nDIA1 and DIA2 groups were followed alternatively. Data\nwere collected between 07:30 and 17:00 h GMT. Every\n30 min, a scan sample (Altmann 1974) was taken on a\nnumber of variables that, according to previous studies, had\nthe potential to influence the monkeys’ vocal behaviour\n(Ouattara et al. 2009a). Specifically, we scored the location\nof the group within its territory (using a map and a grid\nsystem), the degree of group scattering, the group’s main\nactivity, general luminosity and the presence of a neighbouring Diana monkey group (Table 1).\nTable 1 Definition of the scan and focal variables\nName Definition\nScan\nvariables\nTerritory The group is located in a grid cell in the core part of the territory, which represents about 30% of the surface\nexplored (center), or the group is visiting grid cells at the periphery of their usual home range, which represents\nabout 60% of the surface explored (periphery), or the group is out of its usual home range, next to a never visited\narea, which represents about 10% of the surface explored (outside)\nScattering The majority of the individuals, that is, more than 50% of the adults, is (yes) or is not (no) dispersed over an area of\nmore than 25 m2\nActivity The majority of the individuals, that is, more than 50% of the adults, is moving around, foraging for food or\nfeeding on insects/leaves/fruits (foraging), or resting as well as interacting socially (resting) or has initiated a\ngroup movement of at least 100 m in the last 10 min (travelling)\nNeighbours A neighbouring group can (present) or cannot (absent) be heard at less than 200 m\nLuminosity Illumination of the observation area is very bright (bright) or very dark (dark). Luminosity level was estimated by\nmeasuring the intensity (in Lux) of light received 1 m from the forest floor with a luxmeter (DVM401 Voltcraft\nDT8820). For a given scan, 9 points of measurements were equally spaced within a 10 m2 and then averaged.\nThere was a significant difference between both conditions (N = 36 scans, mean ± SEM,\nMbright = 645.7 ± 45.3 Lux, Mdark = 256.6 ± 18.2 Lux, Mann–Whitney test, U = 1,647, P\\0.001)\nFocal\nvariables\nScanning Female is exploring the environment visually\nForaging Female is searching for food in the leaves, on the trunk or on the floor\nFeeding Female is feeding on fruits, leaves or insects\nWalking Female is walking\nJumping Female is jumping\nResting Female is resting or grooming herself\nFriendly\nsocial\nFemale is involved in a positive social interaction such as grooming\nAgonistic\nsocial\nFemale is involved in an aggressive social interaction such as threatening another individual\nNeutral\nsocial\nFemale is involved in a neutral social interaction, for example another individual passes by\nVigilance Female is in a general state of alertness\nAnim Cogn (2012) 15:327–339 329\n123\nBetween scans, adult females were monitored alternatively following a 10-min focal animal sampling procedure\n(Altmann 1974). We systematically described the female’s\nbehaviour, according to the behavioural categories described in Table 1. Efforts were made to equalise the amount\nof observation effort for each female.\nRecordings were made 5–25 m from the focal female\n(depending on her elevation in the canopy) with a Sennheiser K6/ME66 directional microphone and a Marantz\nPMD660 solid-state recorder (sampling rate, 44.1 kHz;\nresolution, 16 bits). The observer (AC) complemented her\nobservations with a running commentary on the behaviour\nof focal individuals, recorded with a Lavallier microphone\nto the recorder’s second channel and later transcribed.\nAcoustic analyses\nSpectrograms were generated with RAVEN 1.3 software\n(Cornell Laboratory of Ornithology, Ithaca, New York).\nPoor-quality recordings were discarded (3.7%). From the\nremaining sample, we first categorised the recordings\naccording to the main call types, following visual and\nauditory assessments and taking into account previous\nfindings from work on Campbell’s monkeys’ vocal\nbehaviour (Lemasson and Hausberger 2011; Fig. 1a). We\nthen validated our classification with a basic acoustic\nanalysis of call structure conducted on a subset of calls\nfrom the same females to control for individual differences\n(Fig. 1b; Table 2). It was based on total duration, minimum\nfundamental frequency (F0min) and maximum fundamental frequency (F0max). We also took a number of measurements that were more suited to some call types, such as\namplitude and duration of frequency modulation in trilled\ncalls and the number of units and duration of the first unit\nin the multi-unit calls.\nContextual analyses\nOur goal was to investigate the link between a given call\ntype and its context of emission. Consequently, behaviours\nnot associated with a vocalisation by the focal individual\nwere not further considered. The influence of context on\ncall production was investigated at two levels. ‘General’\ncontext was based on data collected during scan sampling,\nwhile ‘immediate’ context was based on data collected\nduring focal animal sampling. Continuous observations\nfrom focal sampling were divided into 30-s intervals to\ndetermine which of the ten aforementioned behavioural\ncategories were produced by the focal animal when calling\n(see Lemasson et al. 2004). Our prospective analysis on\ndetailed behavioural categories showed trends that brought\nus to lump the different behaviours into more general\nbiologically relevant categories, as follows: (a) sociopositive or relaxed situations (‘resting’, ‘foraging’, ‘feeding’ and ‘positive social interaction’), (b) neutral situations\n(‘scanning’, ‘walking’ and ‘neutral social interaction’) or\n(c) socio-negative or potentially dangerous situations\n(‘jumping’, ‘negative social interaction’ and ‘vigilance’).\nIn Diana monkeys, social calls typically trigger a vocal\nresponse by another group member within a few seconds\n([60% of cases; Uster and Zuberbu¨hler 2001). We thus\ncounted the number of calls emitted 3 s prior and after a focal\nanimal’s call to determine whether the call was (a) isolated\n(no other call 3 s before nor after), (b) exchanged (1–3 other\ncalls separated by a less than 3 s, with no call overlap: see\nLemasson et al. 2010) or (c) chorused (at least 4 other calls\nwith overlapping).\nStatistical analyses\nTo test for morphological differences between the call\ntypes, we performed a discriminant function analysis\n(DFA) based on the three basic acoustic variables that\nwere measurable on every call type: total duration and the\nminimum and the maximum fundamental frequency. To\ncontrol for individual differences, we used the same\nnumber of calls per call type from each female. The\nclassification results were based on equal probabilities of\nclass (call type) membership. After generating the discriminant function, we used the leave-one-out classification procedure to verify our subjective classification. In\nthis cross-validation procedure, each call is classified by\nthe functions derived from all other calls. The ideal\nprocedure to investigate the influence of context on call\nstructure would have been to conduct a multivariate\nanalysis including all possible contexts of emission.\nUnfortunately, this was not possible due to insufficient\nsample size. Instead, we conducted separate tests for each\ncontextual variable while avoiding multiple comparisons\non the same data set. The relations between call types and\ncontext of emission were examined at the individual level,\nexcept for rare call types where small sample size precluded this level of analysis. Although less rigorous, we\ndecided to carry out analyses at the level because this\nprovided us with a crucial basis for comparisons with\ncombined calls. We performed G tests of independence\non contingency tables of call types versus contextual\ncategories to assess which associations were the strongest\n(see Bouchet et al. 2010). When the expected values were\nsmall, we corrected the G statistics for continuity,\naccording to Williams (1976). For the analyses at the\nindividual level, all females were included, provided we\nhad recordings of their calls in the respective context, and\nsubjected to Wilcoxon signed-rank tests. Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 17.0 software. All tests\nwere two-tailed, and significance was set at a = 0.05.\n330 Anim Cogn (2012) 15:327–339\n123\nnone High pitched trill (H) Low-pitched trill (L) Repeated (R )\nnone\nH L R\nRAb\nfull (f)\nAf HAf LAf RAf\nLAb\nTYPE OF INTRODUCTION\nTYPE OF ARCH\nbroken (b)\nAb HAb\n2Kz\n200ms\nF0max\nD D F0min\nb\n2Kz\n200ms\nF0max\nF0min\nD D\nFig. 1 a Spectrographic\nrepresentation of the calls and\nacoustic parameters measured.\nSpectrograms were produced\nusing a Hanning window\nfunction; filter bandwidth,\n124 Hz; frequency resolution,\n86.1 Hz; grid time resolution,\n5.80 ms. a Calls were classified\naccording to two criteria: in\ncolumns, the presence and type\nof arched frequency modulation,\nand in lines, the presence and\ntype of introductory unit.\nb Shows the total duration (D),\nminimum (F0 min) and\nmaximum (F0max) of\nfundamental frequency\nmeasured\nAnim Cogn (2012) 15:327–339 331\n123\nResults\nAcoustic morphology analysis\nCall types\nA total of N = 2,129 vocalisations were collected during\n58 h of focal sampling. We found four different call types\nreferred to as ‘H’ (high-pitched trilled calls), ‘L’ (lowpitched trilled calls), ‘R’ (repeated-unit calls) and ‘A’\n(arched frequency modulation calls). ‘H’ calls were continuous high-pitched quavered structures with a descending\nfrequency modulation ranging from 1,237 ± 616 to\n358 ± 87 Hz (Table 2). ‘L’ calls were continuous lowpitched quavered structures with a general ascending frequency modulation ranging from 247 ± 84 to 664 ±\n354 Hz. Importantly, ‘H’ and ‘L’ calls were structurally\ndiscrete, not variants of a graded continuum. Although both\ntypes of call structure were trilled, we found no intermediate forms, suggesting they were separate types. ‘R’ calls\nwere composed of one to four brief (25–34 ms) generally\natonal sounds, separated by short (40–57 ms) periods of\nsilence. ‘A’ calls were characterised by a tonal archedshape frequency modulation of 3,047 ± 774 Hz. We were\nable to distinguish two subtypes of ‘A’ call, based on\nwhether the arch was continuous (‘Af’: full arch) or broken\n(‘Ab’: broken arch).\nThree acoustic parameters (D, F0min and F0max) were\nsufficient to discriminate significantly between the four call\ntypes (DFA: Wilk’s k = 0.111, v2 = 707.295, Df = 6,\nP\\0.001, Fig. 2). The discriminant analysis derived three\nfunctions (one less than the number of categories) with the\nfirst accounting for 84.7% of the variance and the second for\nan additional 15.3%. The success rate of classification was\nhigher than expected from a random assignment, both in the\noriginal (88.9%, N = 323) and in the leave-one-out crossvalidation procedure (88.0%). In addition, ‘Ab’ subtypes\ndiffered from ‘Af’ subtypes by the presence of a long silence\ngap in the arched modulation, representing on average\n37% of the total duration (mean ± SD = 114 ± 65 ms;\nN = 119 calls from 6 females; range, 87–142 ms).\nWe further confirmed the generality of our classification by showing that each type and subtype was present in\nat least two adult females of both habituated groups\n(Table 3).\nCall combinations\nOur results showed that females could produce four call\ntypes (‘H’, ‘L’, ‘R’ and ‘A’) either alone or combined in\nTable 2 Acoustic parameters\nCalls\nH LR A\nN females 2 6 5 6\nN calls 8 56 43 216\nD (ms) 288 ± 76 409 ± 106 82 ± 29 298 ± 105\n(241:410) (326:499) (68:99) (241:410)\nF0max (Hertz) 1,237 ± 616 664 ± 354 429 ± 199 3,090 ± 696\n(530:2,865) (223:1,327) (169:1,189) (604:4,282)\nF0min (Hertz) 358 ± 87 247 ± 84 331 ± 170 324 ± 233\n(197:633) (105:535) (144:500) (105:2,865)\nAmfosc (Hertz) 379 ± 67 184 ± 44 – –\n(364:394) (167:202)\nDfosc (Hertz) 26 ± 9 28 ± 8– –\n(20:33) (23:35)\nNbU – – 1.83 ± 0.98 –\n(1:2.85)\nDU1 (ms) – – 28 ± 11 –\n(25:34)\nDiU (ms) – – 46 ± 18 –\n(40:57)\nFirst row shows the number of calls measured and the number of females contributing to the data set selected for acoustic analyses.

We found combinations\nof ‘H’ and ‘A’ calls (‘HA’ combination), ‘L’ and ‘A’ calls\n(‘LA’ combinations) and ‘R’ and ‘A’ calls (‘RA’ combinations), with either full (‘Af’) or broken (‘Ab’) arched\ncomponents. Although other combinations would have\nbeen possible, we did not find them. Instead, combined\ncalls were always introduced by ‘H’, ‘L’ or ‘R’ call type\nfollowed by one of the two arched call subtypes. The most\ncommon utterances were uncombined ‘A’ calls and ‘LA’\ncombinations (respectively 17 calls per hour and almost 20\ncalls per hour), while all other structures were much more\nrare (‘RA’: 2.7 calls per hour; ‘H’: 1.3 calls per hour; ‘HA’,\n‘L’ and ‘R’: less than 1 call per hour; Table 3).\nContextual analyses\nCall types\nCall types could be discriminated by their context of\nemission. ‘H’ calls were significantly associated with high\nmobility, high spatial cohesion, being outside of the territory, high luminosity and the presence of neighbours\n(G tests of independence, Table 4). ‘H’ calls were also\nsignificantly associated with socio-positive or relaxed situations and were often uttered in isolation. ‘L’ calls were\nsignificantly associated with high mobility, low spatial\ncohesion, being in the center of the territory, high luminosity and vocal chorusing (Table 4). ‘R’ calls were significantly associated with being in the center of the\nterritory, high spatial cohesion, low luminosity and socionegative situations. ‘R’ calls were uttered mainly in\nisolation of other vocal behaviour. ‘A’ calls finally were\nassociated with group resting, being in the core area of the\nterritory, low spatial cohesion, low luminosity, neutral\nsituations and vocal exchanges (Table 4). Although ‘L’\nwas the only type to show no association with an immediate non-vocal context, it was significantly different from\nthe ‘R’ type (‘R’ associated with socio-negative situations\nand ‘L’ with neutral situations, G test of independence,\nG = 8.9, Df = 2, P = 0.0115), while it did not differ\nsignificantly from ‘H’ or ‘A’ type (G tests of independence,\nG = 2.2, Df = 2, P = 0.3357 and G = 2.2, Df = 2,\nP = 0.3368, respectively). In sum, each call type had a\nparticular contextual profile. Specifically, ‘A’ call type was\ncontextually more neutral than the other calls and was the\nonly type preferentially used during vocal exchanges.\nArched call subtypes\nThe arched call type ‘A’ occupies a key position in the\nvocal repertoire of female Diana monkeys ([95% of all\ncalls; Table 3) with the two subtypes ‘Af’ and ‘Ab’ differing in contextual use. The ‘Af’ subtype was emitted\nsignificantly more frequently than the ‘Ab’ if neighbours\nwere nearby (Wilcoxon two-tailed test: N = 14, Z =\n2.229, Pexact = 0.026), the luminosity was low (N = 14,\nZ = 2.103, Pexact = 0.035), the caller jumped (N = 15,\nZ = 2.045, Pexact = 0.041) or was engaged in an agonistic\ninteraction (N = 15, Z = 2.032, Pexact = 0.047). The ‘Af’\nsubtype was also significantly more frequent than the ‘Ab’\nduring choruses (N = 15, Z = 2.480, Pexact = 0.01).\nConversely, the ‘Ab’ subtype was more frequent when the\nneighbours were absent (Wilcoxon two-tailed test: N = 14,\nZ = 2.229, Pexact = 0.026) and when the caller was resting\n(N = 15, Z = 2.556, Pexact = 0.008). ‘Ab’ subtypes were\nalso more frequent, though not significantly, when calls\nwere uttered in isolation (N = 15, Z = 1.915, Pexact =\n0.058). Table 5 summarises the main effects. In sum,\nthere were significant differences in the contextual use of\nthe two arched subtypes, with ‘Af’ subtype preferentially\nused in situations when providing identity cues was\nimportant.\nCall combinations\nBoth ‘L’ and ‘R’ calls were found in combination with ‘A’\ncalls (i.e. ‘LA’ and ‘RA’ combinations), depending on the\ncontext of emission. ‘LA’ combinations were emitted significantly more often than ‘RA’ combinations when the\ngroup was foraging (Wilcoxon two-tailed test, N = 15\nfemales, Z = 2.954, Pexact = 0.002), during call exchanges\n(N = 15 females, Z = 2.124, Pexact = 0.001), when the\ncaller was resting (N = 15, Z = 2.271, Pexact = 0.021),\ninvolved in a friendly social interaction (N = 15,\nFig. 2 Results of the discriminant function analysis\nAnim Cogn (2012) 15:327–339 333\n123\nTable 3 Female’s individual vocal repertoires\nIndividuals (time in hours) Call type (number of calls per hour)\nH L R Ab Af HAb HAf LAb LAf RAb RAf Total\ni1 (7.00 h) 1 (0.1) 54 (7.7) 3 (1.4) 45 (6.4) 12 (1.7) 8 (1.1) 7 (1) 130 (18.6)\ni2 (3.66 h) 3 (0.8) 1 (0.3) 35 (9.6) 12 (3.3) 1 (0.3) 25 (6.8) 20 (5.5) 2 (0.5) 4 (1.1) 103 (28.2)\ni3 (1.65 h) 21 (12.8) 1 (0.6) 2 (1.2) 3 (1.8) 27 (16.4)\ni4 (0.48 h) 2 (4.2) 3 (6.3) 1 (2.1) 1 (2.1) 7 (14.6)\ni5 (2.00 h) 3 (1.5) 2 (1) 29 (14.5) 2 (1) 1 (0.5) 17 (8.5) 5 (2.5) 59 (29.5)\ni6 (0.54 h) 3 (5.5) 5 (9.2) 1 (8.1) 9 (16.6)\ni7 (0.64 h) 7 (10.9) 14 (21.7) 2 (3.1) 12 (18.6) 35 (54.3)\ni8 (1.35 h) 1 (0.7) 1 (0.7) 2 (1.5) 12 (8.9) 1 (0.7) 156 (105.2) 173 (127.8)\ni9 (0.56 h) 3 (5.4) 9 (16.2) 1 (1.8) 1 (1.8) 14 (25.1)\ni10 (0.48 h) 8 (16.7) 10 (20.8) 1 (2.1) 1 (2.1) 20 (41.7)\ni11 (2.91 h) 5 (1.7) 17 (5.6) 92 (31.6) 3 (1) 67 (23) 17 (5.8) 201 (69)\ni12 (4.94 h) 1 (0.2) 6 (1.2) 57 (11.5) 33 (6.7) 50 (10.1) 49 (9.9) 18 (3.6) 214 (43.3)\ni13 (4.55 h) 2 (0.4) 12 (2.6) 44 (9.7) 10 (2.2) 1 (0.2) 1 (0.2) 90 (19.8) 47 (10.3) 4 (0.9) 4 (0.9) 215 (47.2)\ni14 (4.73 h) 49 (10.4) 53 (11.2) 1 (0.2) 2 (0.4) 23 (4.9) 26 (5.5) 154 (32.5)\ni15 (1.68 h) 3 (1.8) 6 (3.6) 7 (4.2) 1 (0.6) 1 (0.6) 10 (6) 28 (16.7)\ni16 (4.64 h) 1 (0.2) 3 (0.6) 46 (9.9) 19 (4.1) 5 (1.1) 11 (2.4) 5 (1.1) 14 (3.0) 104 (22.4)\ni17 (3.63 h) 3 (0.8) 1 (0.3) 53 (14.6) 77 (21.2) 28 (7.7) 131 (36.1) 3 (0.8) 296 (81.5)\ni18 (2.09 h) 3 (1.4) 1 (0.5) 3 (1.4) 35 (16.7) 12 (5.7) 103 (49.2) 2 (1) 159 (75.9)\ni19 (1.42 h) 34 (23.9) 8 (5.6) 9 (6.3) 4 (2.8) 47 (33.1) 102 (71.8)\ntotal (49 h) 62 (1.3) 25 (0.5) 13 (0.3) 418 (8.5) 415 (8.5) 2 (\\0.1) 10 (0.2) 272 (5.5) 703 (14.3) 19 (0.4) 111 (2.3) 2,050 (41.8)\nFor each type of call and each female (DIA1 group: females i1–i9, DIA2 group: females i10–i19), the number of calls and call combinations emitted is given.

Conversely, ‘RA’\ncombinations were uttered significantly more in isolation\nthan ‘LA’ calls (N = 15, Z = 2.354, Pexact = 0.017) and\nwere more frequent, though not significantly, when the\ngroup was not scattered (N = 15, Z = 1.956, Pexact =\n0.054). ‘HA’ combinations also existed but were too rare to\nbe included in this analysis. Table 5 summarises the main\neffects obtained when conducting the analysis at the individual level. Interestingly, at the population level, ‘LA’\ncombinations were still significantly associated with positive situations, while ‘RA’ combinations were significantly\nassociated with negative situations (G test, G = 13.5,\nDf = 2, Pexact = 0.0012). In sum, there were significant\ndifferences in the contextual use of ‘LA’ and ‘RA’ call\ncombinations.\nDiscussion\nWe carried out an observational study to investigate the\nlevels of flexibility in female Diana monkey’s social calls.\nWe found flexibility at two levels, variability in acoustic structures and combinations of these structures into\nmore complex utterances. Both mechanisms significantly\nenlarged females’ vocal repertoire that consisted of only\nfour basic call types (‘H’, ‘R’, ‘L’ and ‘A’). First, we\nobserved non-random combinations of the four basic calls,\nwhich increased the repertoire to seven types of utterances\n(‘H’, ‘L’, ‘R’, ‘A’, ‘HA’, ‘LA’ and ‘RA’). Second, we\nfound that, within the most frequently emitted call type\n(‘A’), females produced two subtypes characterised by\ndifferences in the frequency modulation, which in turn\nincreased the repertoire to eleven utterances.\nThe shape of the frequency modulation of ‘A’ calls\n(arch broken or full) is a pattern also seen in the calls of\nother guenon species (Gautier 1988). For instance, female\nCampbell’s monkeys produce six subtypes of ‘CH’ calls,\nwhich seem to be the structural and contextual analogue\nof the ‘LA’ combinations of Diana monkeys. Campbell’s\nmonkeys also produce broken and full arches in relation\nto different contexts, regardless of the caller’s age\n(Lemasson and Hausberger 2004, 2011). In individuals\nraised in captivity, the full arch encoded information\nabout caller’s identity and affiliative bonds. Call structure\nchanged across years in adult females, and playback\nexperiments showed that females reacted differently to\ncurrent and to no longer produced variants of familiar\nfemales (Lemasson et al. 2005). Although presumably\nother calls are also individually distinctive, we found that\nDiana females preferentially used the full arched calls\nwhen revealing identity was particularly important, such\nas during periods of low visibility, when facing an\nopponent and during auditory confusing environments\nsuch as call choruses. The full arched frequency\nTable 4 Contextual analyses of\ncall types\nThe total number of ‘H’, ‘L’,\n’R’ and ‘A’ calls recorded in\neach context is given.

Indeed, both levels of flexibility—acoustic modulation and combination—turned out to be context-related\nin this species, showing that the cohesion–contact calls\nsystem of Diana monkeys contains subtleties that go\nbeyond a simple function of individual identification and\nspatial positioning, as originally proposed by early studies\n(Gautier 1988). When uttered alone, ‘H’ and ‘R’ types\nwere associated with social activities and contexts relating\nto high group spatial cohesion and were uttered in isolation. ‘H’ calls were given when in the outer parts of the\nhome range, in the presence of neighbours and when\nluminosity was high, while ‘R’ calls were given in the\ncenter of the territory and when luminosity was poor. ‘L’\nand ‘A’ types were more typically associated with neutral\ncontexts, when the group was scattered and when the vocal\nactivity was high. Importantly, ‘H’ calls were emitted\nin situations that were ‘socially positive or relaxed’ for the\nemitter while ‘R’ calls were emitted in ‘socially negative or\npotentially dangerous situations’. The majority of ‘L’ calls\nuttered alone were emitted during a ‘neutral situation’,\nTable 5 Contextual profiles of arched calls depending on the introduction (‘LA’ vs. ‘RA’) or the subtype of arch (‘Ab’ vs. ‘Af’)\nVariable Parameters N females % of calls N females % of calls\nLA RA Ab Af\nTerritory Outside 10 18.5 ± 6.1 19.5 ± 7.4 15 11.9 ± 4 17.8 ± 5.8\nPeriphery 45.4 ± 7.5 28.6 ± 5.8 39.1 ± 8.2 38.8 ± 4\nCenter 36.1 ± 9.2 33.8 ± 7.8 49 ± 8.4 43.5 ± 7.3\nGroup spread No 15 30.2 ± 6 47.9 ± 9.8 15 60.6 ± 6 61.2 ± 4.4\nYes 69 ± 6 46 ± 9.9 34.2 ± 6.2 36.8 ± 4.8\nGroup activity Foraging 15 84.9 ± 2.9** 48.9 ± 10 15 71.0 ± 5.7 76.6 ± 4\nTravelling 6.4 ± 2.5 5.5 ± 3.5 16.1 ± 7.8 8.1 ± 3.4\nResting 9.9 ± 2.5 16.8 ± 5.8 19.2 ± 5.3 14.4 ± 3.3\nNeighbours Absent 11 79.7 ± 6.9 87.8 ± 4.8 14 87.1 ± 4.5* 76.3 ± 5.8\nPresent 20.3 ± 6.9 12.2 ± 4.8 12.9 ± 4.5* 23.4 ± 5.8\nLuminosity Dark 12 13.4 ± 4 13.1 ± 4.3 14 26.6 ± 7.4* 43.9 ± 8.4\nBright 22.6 ± 5.2 19.7 ± 5.2 63.9 ± 9.3 56.1 ± 8.4\nImmediate non-vocal (detailed) Scanning 15 61.1 ± 6.1 57 ± 0.8 15 58.8 ± 7 69.1 ± 4.1\nForaging 38.3 ± 6.1 31.8 ± 7.4 27.3 ± 5.2 35.5 ± 2.3\nFeeding 29.5 ± 3.7 27.9 ± 0.9 27.8 ± 4.4 30 ± 3.4\nJumping 26 ± 6.2 29.3 ± 0.2 18.5 ± 6.1* 24.7 ± 3.9\nWalking 49.9 ± 5.9 49 ± 10 56.4 ± 5.4 58.1 ± 4.6\nResting 14 ± 3.1* 4 ± 1.8 21.3 ± 3.3** 10.6 ± 1.9\nFriendly interaction 3.6 ± 1.7* 0 ± 0 6.8 ± 5.7 2 ± 0.8\nAgonistic interaction 1.1 ± 0.6 2.2 ± 2.2 0.5 ± 0.4* 2 ± 0.7\nNeutral interaction 3.8 ± 1.6 2.4 ± 1.8 5.2 ± 1.7 4 ± 1\nVigilance 2 ± 0.7 3.2 ± 1.8 4.6 ± 2.1 4.7 ± 1.4\nImmediate non-vocal (lumped) Positive 15 84.2 ± 4.6* 62 ± 14.4 15 28.7 ± 3.1 24.3 ± 1.2\nNegative 27.6 ± 5.8 30.4 ± 8.7 7.6 ± 2 9.7 ± 1.3\nNeutral 126.1 ± 11.9 111.2 ± 19.2 40 ± 1.9 40.8 ± 1.1\nImmediate vocal Isolated 15 8.7 ± 1.8* 27.5 ± 5.6 15 22.5 ± 4.8 12.7 ± 1.7\nExchanged 83.6 ± 3** 37.7 ± 8.3 73.6 ± 4.9 77.6 ± 1.3\nChorus 7.6 ± 1.7 8.1 ± 3.9 3.9 ± 1.3** 9.7 ± 2\nTable shows females’ mean proportion of ‘LA’ combinations and ‘RA’ combinations, as well as the mean proportion of ‘Ab’ and ‘Af’ calls\nemitted in each contextual category.

It is\nhence possible that these three call types form a gradient\nreflecting the general motivational state of the caller. In\ncontrast, ‘A’ calls uttered alone differed from the previous\ncall types in several ways. They were emitted much more\nfrequently, were contextually neutral and were typically\nused during vocal exchanges.\nCall combinations were optional and always in the form\nof a two-compound utterance with the first call used as an\nintroductory unit followed by one of two subtypes of\narched calls. In addition, when females produced call\ncombinations, their contexts of emission were not fundamentally different from the contextual profile of the same\ncalls emitted alone (either the introductory unit or the\narched call). Instead, call combination seemed to modulate\nthe utterance of an ‘A’ call with a contextual value\nregarding the immediate situation faced by the emitter in\nterms of ‘positive or relaxed’, ‘negative or potentially\ndangerous’ or ‘neutral’ situation. One hypothesis is that the\n‘A’ call could function as an individual identifier combined\nwith or without contextual situation. A similar finding has\nrecently been reported in Campbell’s monkeys, where\nfemales emit ‘LA’-like combinations in which the ‘L’-like\npart reveals something about the caller’s kin relatedness\nand the ‘A’-like part the caller’s social bonds (Lemasson\nand Hausberger 2011). For Diana monkeys, further work is\nneeded to explore the kind of information conveyed by\ndifferences in arch structures.\nCombinatorial properties may be more widespread in\nprimate communication than previously reported, although\nvery little is still known about the informational content\nof these combinations if compared to the single units\n(Zuberbu¨hler 2002; Crockford and Boesch 2005; Ouattara\net al. 2009a, b). Traditionally, analyses of primate vocal\nbehaviour have been carried out at the level of the individual call type, but as stated by Hauser (2000), sequences\nmay also be communicatively relevant (see Bouchet et al.\n2010). In non-primate taxa, sequence-based investigations\nare more common (e.g. songbirds: Kroodsma (1982), killer\nwhales Orcinus orca: Shapiro et al. 2010), although this\nhas not generated much progress in terms of contextspecific production.\nWhen compared to previous studies in closely related\nspecies, the combinatorial system of social calls in Diana\nmonkeys showed some parallels with the affixation system\nin Campbell’s monkeys (Ouattara 2009a), although a\nnumber of important differences were also present. Specifically, there was no evidence that Diana monkeys’\ncombinations of social calls carried strong semantic content relating to specific events, such as a falling tree, the\napproach of a neighbouring group (Ouattara et al. 2009b)\nor a signal for group progression (Arnold and Zuberbu¨hler\n2006). Instead, the combinations of social calls seen in\nDiana monkeys appear to convey the individual identity of\nthe caller (most likely, though not exclusively, to be found\nin the arched frequency modulation) and something about\nthe immediate motivational state the caller finds herself in,\nthat is, whether she assesses the current situation as positive, negative or neutral (found in the introductory call). A\nparticularly interesting case is the rare ‘HA’ combinations\nwhose communicative function will require more\ninvestigations.\nWhatever the function of non-random concatenation of\ncalls is, it is clear that this behaviour can significantly\nenlarge the vocal repertoire of a species and expand the\nfunctional use of calls, which may be particularly relevant\nfor species that have little control over call morphology.\nSimilar arguments have been made for male Campbell’s\nmonkeys, where affixation broadens the ‘meaning’ from\npredator-specific alarm calls to calls given to a broader\nclass of disturbances (Ouattara et al. 2009a). In male puttynosed monkeys, ‘pyow-hack’ combinations carry different\n‘meanings’ than pure ‘pyow’ or ‘hack’ series (Arnold and\nZuberbu¨hler 2006). In Diana monkeys, the concatenation\nof one of several possible introductory calls to the arched\ncall unit seems to function as a contextual refiner of this\ncontextually neutral call. The degree to which these subtleties are intentionally produced, mere reflections of a\ncaller’s motivational state (Owings and Morton 1998;\nOwren and Rendall 2001) or both has not been addressed\nby this study and will require further investigation.\nTo conclude, we evidenced optional and potentially\npartially redundant combinatorial properties in the social\ncalling system of female Diana monkeys, the first evidence\nof this kind for short-distance vocalisations used in social\ncontexts. This study brings new insights into the mechanism by which non-human primates can achieve enhanced\nacoustic flexibility, something that may be especially\nimportant during social interactions. The degree to which\nthis and other non-human primate combinatorial calling\nsystems are relevant for understanding the early biological\nroots of human language is currently unclear and much\ndebated. The outcome of this debate will also largely\ndepend on whether similar properties can be found in the\ncalling systems of our closest relatives, the chimpanzees\nand bonobos.\nAcknowledgments This research was funded by the French Ministry of Research, IUF, PICS-CNRS and ANR ‘Orilang’.

Song structure terminology has been well-established and used by many\nauthors, though at times inconsistently. This review discusses the development of\nthe nomenclature describing humpback song and explores the potential significance\nof the often-overlooked variation in song patterns. Within the hierarchical definition\nof humpback song, the most problematic issues arise from the inconsistent delineation of phrase types, and the use of the metric of song duration without regards to\nvariability in thematic sequence. With regards to the former, a set of guidelines is\nsuggested to facilitate consistent delineation of phrases. With regards to the latter,\ncurrent research demonstrates that the “song duration” metric has resulted in the disregard of variability at this level, which is more widespread than traditionally\nreported. An exemplar case is used to highlight the problem inherent in defining\nand measuring song duration. Humpback song is evaluated within the framework of\navian songbird research, and a shift in analysis paradigm is recommended, towards\nphrase-based analyses in which sequences of phrases are treated as a salient feature of\nsong pattern.\nKey words: humpback whale, Megaptera novaeangliae, song structure, song classification, eventual variety, avian song.\nVariation in a behavioral trait provides the opportunity for selection and evolution,\nand therefore is of interest to behavioral ecologists. Detailed qualitative description of\na species’ behavior, such as their sound repertoire, is important. Nevertheless, the\nquestions that drive the advancement of knowledge about a species’ communication\n1\nCorresponding author (e-mail: danielle.cholewiak@noaa.gov).\n2 Current address: Protected Species Branch, Northeast Fisheries Science Center/NOAA/NMFS, 166\nWater Street, Woods Hole, Massachusetts, 02543, U.S.A. 3 Current address: LaB – Laborato´rio de Bioacu´stica/Bioacoustics Lab, Departamento de Fisiologia/\nDepartment of Physiology, Centro de Biocieˆncias/Biosciences Center, Universidade Federal do Rio Grande\ndo Norte/Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte, C.P. 1511, Natal, RN, Brazil 59078-970,\nE312\nsystem are often answered by quantitative analyses of the variation in specific traits.\nHere we review and discuss the development of the nomenclature describing humpback song and explore the potential significance of the often-overlooked variation in\nsong patterns.\nA Short History of the Study of Humpback Whale Song\nAs recently as the 1940s, scientists did not know whether baleen whales produced\nsounds. Although cetacean sounds were apparently well known to historic whalers\n(Aldrich 1889), the early scientific community concluded that cetaceans were mute\nbased upon the discovery that they did not possess vocal chords (Schevill and\nWatkins 1962). It was not until after the confirmation of sound production by odontocetes (Fraser 1947, Kullenberg 1947, Schevill and Lawrence 1949) that scientists\nbegan to realize that mysticetes also produced vocalizations.\nThe first documentation of humpback vocalizations within the scientific community was presented in 1952, when Schreiber (1952) recorded sounds with a “musical\nquality” off the island of Oahu, which he attributed to marine life. We now know\nthat these musical sounds were produced by humpback whales. A decade of research\nafter Schreiber’s discovery, uncovered the fact that humpbacks produce a wide range\nof vocalizations on the breeding grounds and en route to them, as well as on the feeding grounds. By 1964 their breeding sounds were becoming well known: “…the\nsonorous moans and screams associated with the migrations of Megaptera past\nBermuda and Hawaii may be an audible manifestation of more fundamental vernal\nurges…” (Schevill 1964). Off the coast of New Zealand, acousticians were making\nsimilar discoveries, although they did not positively identify the sounds as humpback\nin origin. They described how a “…chorus of squeals, creaks, cries, barks, groans, and\nwhoops…” had been labeled the “Barnyard Chorus” by the laboratory staff (Kibblewhite et al. 1967). The same author even supposed that one individual might produce\nall the different sounds in this chorus, though he did not attempt to confirm this.\nIronically, these New Zealand researchers may have documented the (near) extirpation of a humpback whale breeding population through acoustic monitoring without\nrealizing it; they described the decline in these sounds from 1960 to 1963, and stated\nthat no positive instances were recorded after 1963. Around the same time, a spectrographic catalog of some of the sounds known to be produced by humpback whales\ndemonstrated the diversity of these vocalizations (Tavolga 1968). In 1970, in a technical report written for the Naval Undersea Research and Development Center,\nCummings and Philippi (1970) describe repetitive “stanzas” recorded in late December in the northwest Atlantic. Their low sampling rate precluded the detection of any\nsounds above 175 Hz, yet the authors were able to identify sound series that lasted\n11–14 min, including pulses, blips, and moans. They tentatively identified these\nsounds as being North Atlantic right whale (Eubalaena glacialis) vocalizations; in all\nlikelihood, they were actually listening to humpback whales (Payne and Payne\n1971).\nIt seems that scientists working in every ocean basin were on the verge of a new\ndiscovery, but it was not until 1969 that these sounds were finally reported by Roger\nand Katy Payne as the “song” produced by humpback whales (Anonymous 1969),\nfollowed shortly thereafter by a conference presentation by Howard Winn (Winn\net al. 1970). In 1971 Payne and McVay published a pivotal paper describing the patterned, hierarchical structure of these sounds, making the first connection with bird\nREVIEW ARTICLE E313\nsong. These authors relied on Broughton’s (1963) definitions of the term song,\nincluding: “… a series of notes, generally of more than one type, uttered in succession\nand so related as to form a recognizable sequence or pattern in time,” recognizing that\nwhat humpbacks were producing fit into this framework. Winn and Winn (1978)\nsupported this discovery with a separate description of the patterned sequences of\nsounds recorded from humpback whales in Bermuda and the West Indies, and a\nslightly different approach towards characterization of song structure than Payne and\nMcVay (1971).\nFrom that time on, investigations regarding the complexity, function, and pattern\nin humpback whale song have increasingly grown in number. In 1979 the first paper\nattempting to quantify signature information in song units was published (Hafner\net al. 1979). The authors did not recognize the significance of the evolving nature of\nhumpback song at this time, and thus variation due to temporal changes was\nconfounded with individual variation. Temporal variation, or rapid cultural evolution, was soon to be described in detail (Guinee et al. 1983, Payne et al. 1983, Payne\nand Payne 1985). Singing humpback whales were shown to be males (Glockner\n1983), and the function of song within the breeding season was hypothesized to play\na role in female attraction (Winn and Winn 1978, Herman and Tavolga 1980, Tyack\n1981) or mediate male-male interactions (Darling 1983, Darling et al. 2006, Cholewiak 2008). Further studies have compared song patterns across regions (e.g., Payne\nand Guinee 1983, Helweg et al. 1990, Cerchio et al. 2001, Darling and Sousa-Lima\n2005, Garland et al. 2011), or seasons (Winn and Winn 1978; Matilla et al. 1987;\nNoad et al. 2000; Eriksen et al. 2005; Mercado et al. 2003, 2005). This work has\nrepeatedly demonstrated four universally observed features of humpback song: (1)\npopulations or groups of males that are in acoustic contact at some point in time and\nspace sing “similar” songs, which is to say that their songs are comprised of visually\nand aurally recognizable similarities in pattern that are characteristic of that time/\nregion; (2) the overall hierarchical structure is observed globally, thus a heritable species-level characteristic, although the details of song patterns differ between populations of males that are acoustically isolated during all seasons; (3) song patterns\nchange over time as a result of individual males modifying the spectral and temporal\nfeatures of song units, as well as their order and repetition; and (4) males in acoustic\ncontact incorporate similar changes into their own songs, maintaining continuity\nwithin populations despite progressive temporal changes.\nBetween the 1970s and early 1980s, the terminology used to describe humpback\nwhale songs was firmly cemented within the scientific literature (Payne and McVay\n1971, Payne et al. 1983). Other authors occasionally varied this vocabulary (Winn\nand Winn 1978), but for the most part it has remained in use as originally proposed\nby Payne and McVay. This terminology is not, however, without complications, and\ninconsistencies in its application have led to incongruities in the literature (for\nexample, compare Thompson and Friedl 1982 with McSweeney et al. 1989).\nDespite the consistency of song patterns exhibited among males within a breeding\npopulation, researchers have noted a fair amount of variation in humpback whale\nsong, both within the songs of an individual and between the songs of different individuals (first noted by Payne and McVay 1971). Early on, Frumhoff (1983) conducted\nan extensive review of “anomalous” songs, and while early analyses suggested that\nsong sequence was extremely stereotyped (Payne and McVay 1971, Winn and Winn\n1978, Payne et al. 1983), later studies have demonstrated that song structure is not\nalways as consistent as was first reported (Helweg et al. 1990, 1992, 1998; Eriksen\net al. 2005). Measurements of variation both on the overall pattern level, as well as on\nE314 MARINE MAMMAL SCIENCE, VOL. 29, NO. 3, 2013\nthe level of individual song units, are clearly important for understanding the\nfunction of song within this species and the influence of sexual selection on singing\nbehavior.\nRecently, there has been an increase in attempts to develop automated procedures\nfor the classification of individual song elements, appearing in both refereed\n(Rickwood and Taylor 2008, Pace et al. 2010, Green et al. 2011) and nonrefereed\nliterature (Mazhar et al. 2008, Picot et al. 2008). These procedures range from semiautomated (requiring manual selection of song elements) to fully automated\n(including both the detection of and classification of song elements). In general, these\nmethodologies are largely still under development and demonstrations of their success\nare as yet limited. Moreover, for studies of song evolution (rather than song element\nclassification), the variation exhibited at individual, population, and temporal levels\nwill likely present a significant problem for automated classifiers to recognize similar\nelements as they undergo progressive change over time. Studies assessing song over\nprotracted geographic or temporal scales require the accurate classification and grouping of similar song elements in order to draw valid conclusions regarding song\ntransmission and behavioral processes, and this is often confounded by sparse\nsampling. There is clearly a need for the development of automated classification systems in order to handle large data sets of recordings; however, no system has yet been\ndemonstrated which compares with the pattern recognition skills of the human brain.\nConsistent and well-defined criteria for the classification and measurement of\nhumpback whale song features are essential for robust comparisons between investigators. In humpback song analyses, arbitrary divisions are imposed on what is otherwise a continuous vocal sequence. At times, these divisions are constructed\ninconsistently. Payne and McVay’s (1971) terminology has been established and used\nby many authors, even though no practical rules were provided to guide the delineation of boundaries between different types of units, phrases, or themes. This lack of\nspecific guidance has contributed to differences among authors in adopting criteria\nused to partition continuous humpback whale singing sessions. Additionally, in light\nof ongoing research, it has become clear that the rigid structure suggested by Payne\nand McVay (1971) is not universally applicable to all songs.\nThe objectives of this review are to (1) suggest consensus criteria for song structure\ndefinitions and discrimination and (2) engage in a discussion on the use of song cycle\nmetrics in the humpback system, with suggestions for revision of the traditional analysis paradigm. While it may not be possible to develop rules that will work universally, we believe that establishing guidelines will be constructive, especially as this\nfield continues to expand rapidly. These suggestions are based upon our combined\nexperience with humpback whale song spanning seven different regions in four ocean\nbasins with recordings collected over three decades. Our aim is to better enable comparable quantitative analyses between investigators. However, we are aware that our\nsuggestions may not be suitable for everyone, therefore we urge future authors to\nexplicitly and thoroughly describe the way they generate the humpback whale song\nclassifications and metrics in their publications.\nReview of Song Structure Definitions and criteria\nThe framework by which humpback whale song is defined and categorized is essentially a model, used to make inference about the singing behavior of humpback\nwhales. As famously noted by Box and Draper (1987), all models are by nature an\nREVIEW ARTICLE E315\napproximation, and the best models approximate closely enough to be useful in inference;\nimportantly, even the most useful of models should regularly be revisited when new\ndata become available to improve upon them. Payne and McVay (1971), in an effort\nto describe their observation of predictable, repetitive vocal cycles, described a hierarchical structure that has been widely adopted and utilized by researchers for over\n30 yr. The shortest sound is called a unit, which may be divided into subunits when\ncomprised of pulses that are too rapid to be individually discriminated at real speed.\nA set of units is combined to form a phrase. Similar phrases are repeated to form a\ntheme. The song is defined as the combination of multiple distinct themes. A song\nsession consists of a series of repeated songs with silent intervals of less than a minute,\nwhich are typically not discernibly longer than those intervals between phrases or\nthemes. Our aim is to assess this framework, identify where it has been useful, and\nsuggest revision where it may be improved.\nSubunits and Units\nThe term subunit is one that has multiple uses within the literature. It was originally defined (Payne and McVay 1971) as a component of a sound that is aurally\nindistinguishable as a discrete vocalization. When examined with appropriate spectrogram parameters or played at a slower rate, seemingly continuous sounds may be\nshown to be composed of discrete pulses (Fig. 1). Grating or rasping sounds may be\nconsidered a single unit, but are actually pulse-trains that are made up of a series of\npulses, or subunits. It is important to note that in these cases, spectrogram parameters\n(such as the number of points in a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)) will determine the\nresolution of subunits.\nMore recently, the term subunit has been adopted primarily to refer to the components of a sound distinguished by frequency discontinuities or inflection points.\nEffort is now being directed towards evaluating whether these sound components\ncan be useful for automatic classification (Pace et al. 2010). This effort reflects the\nprogress within the broader field of automated call classification, in which similar\nanalyses are being conducted on odontocete whistles (Shapiro et al. 2011).\nA unit is defined (Payne and McVay 1971) as the shortest sound that seems continuous when evaluated at real speed (Fig. 2). This is analogous to a “note” or “element”\nin the avian song literature (Issac and Marler 1963). Winn and Winn (1978) called\nthese individual sounds “syllables,” which is somewhat confusing, as “syllables” in\nthe avian literature may actually be composed from groups of notes that have internote intervals of silence that are shorter than the duration of the adjacent notes (Isaac\nand Marler 1963).\nWe suggest that the hierarchical levels of unit and subunit be maintained. These\ndefinitions are simple and unambiguous, allowing robust comparisons. The term unit\nhas been more widely used within the humpback literature, and should be used in\nplace of the term syllable.\nSubphrases and Phrases\nA subphrase (Payne et al. 1983) is a sequence of one or more units that is sometimes\nrepeated in a series (Fig. 2). These units of repetition were called “motifs” by Winn\nand Winn (1978), who divided them into two types: similar (containing only one\ntype of unit, repeated several times) or dissimilar (containing two or more different\nunits, which are repeated in combination several times).\nE316 MARINE MAMMAL SCIENCE, VOL. 29, NO. 3, 2013\nMultiple subphrases are grouped into a phrase (Payne and McVay 1971). Similar\nphrases are generally repeated from a few to many times before a different phrase type\nis introduced (Fig. 2). However, consecutive phrases may have different numbers of\nunits, as well as a change in the spectral and/or temporal characteristics of the units,\nwhile still being identifiable as belonging to the same repetitive sequence. As noted\nby Payne and McVay (1971), phrases are “inexact replicas” of one another. We\nsuggest that the phrase may be considered the salient element of repetition within\nhumpback song. Differing from Payne and McVay’s original interpretation (1971),\nwe propose that the phrase hierarchical level is most analogous to the structural level\nof “song” in the avian literature (see below for further discussion on this topic).\nUnfortunately, the delineation of phrases may be difficult and ambiguous. Typically, the intervals between successive phrases are the same as the intervals between\nunits within a phrase (in contrast to most bird song, where intersong intervals are\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n12345\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n2 2.2 2.4 2.6 2.8\nTime (seconds)\n1234 5\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\nFrequency (kHz)\n12345\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n12345\n2\n3\n4\n5\n1\n3 3.2 3.4 3.6 3.8 4\n1\n2\n5\n4\n3\nTime (seconds)\nA B\nFigure 1.

The delineation\nof phrase structure is subjective, such that a choice needs to be made about where\nwithin a sequence of units one will start a phrase, and at what point variation in\nphrase structure is significant enough to delineate a new phrase type.\nTherefore, differences in methodology between authors make it challenging to\ncompare studies, even of song within the same region.

Irregularities such as these muddle the comparisons.\nHowever, despite challenges in labeling and delineating phrases, multiple authors\nhave recognized that phrase duration is one of the most stable features of humpback\nwhale song, with very low coefficients of variation within and between individuals\n(Frumhoff 1983, Payne et al. 1983, Cerchio 1993, Cerchio et al. 2001). This strongly\nsuggests that there is significance to the phrase as an element that is important to\nhumpback whales, and delineation of phrases is not an arbitrary construct of researchers attempting to force organization upon the display. The same does not appear to\nbe true of the “song” measurement that will be detailed below.\nIn an attempt to partly remedy variability in methodology, we suggest the following simple guidelines for delineating and measuring phrases, which could be adopted\nin any song:\n(1) Consecutive units of similar structure should not be separated within a phrase,\nbut should be kept together as parts of a subphrase.\n(2) Phrases should be delineated in a way that minimizes the occurrence of an\nincomplete phrase at the end of a sequence of similar phrases (also called “hanging” phrases, consisting of only a portion of the repetitive structure, such as one\nsubphrase).\n(3) “Transitional” phrases combine units from two different phrase types (Payne and\nPayne 1985), usually an entire subphrase from the previous and subsequent\nthemes. For example, using letters to indicate subphrases, in the phrase sequence:\nab ab ab ad cd cd cd\nad is a transitional phrase, composed of subphrase “a” and subphrase “d.” These\nphrases should be identified as such, and not mistaken for new phrase types.\n(4) Care should be taken to recognize inherent variation within phase types, and\nthereby to distinguish between patterns that are variants of a single phrase type\nvs. completely different phrase types. Variation within a phrase type may involve\ndifferences in structure or repetition of units, without a consequent shift in the\noverall pattern of the subphrase or phrase; conversely, when the pattern, composition and/or number of units in a phrase dramatically differs, and is maintained\nwithin the sequence, a completely different phrase type should be defined. This is\nnot necessarily to advocate lumping over splitting, but rather to define different\nlevels of variation. As this process is unavoidably qualitative and somewhat subjective, exemplar spectrograms illustrating different phrases and variants should\nalways be presented in publications, and authors (and editors) should avoid\nreporting phrase classification only nominally without supporting figures.\n(5) Duration of phrases should be measured including the interval between phrases\n(i.e., measuring from the onset of the first unit in one phrase to the onset of the\nanalogous unit in the subsequent phrase). Measurements made in this way will\nbe robust regardless of how one chooses to delineate phrases. In fact, if measured\nconsistently, phrase duration has the least variation within and between singers\nof a particular population (Frumhoff 1983, Cerchio et al. 2001).\n(6) A review of song based on recordings of multiple individuals is essential for\nappropriately assigning phrase presence and structure; song structure should\nnever be delineated based on recordings from a single individual, and only cautiously for small samples of individuals. When there is ambiguity in the assignment\nREVIEW ARTICLE E319\nof units to phrases, we urge authors to search for consistency in interindividual\npattern or consistency in subphrase structure.\nWe suggest that the hierarchical level of the phrase be maintained, with closer\nattention being given to criteria used to delineate phrases. In addition, the use of\nrecordings that provide adequate signal-to-noise ratio and encompass the entire\nfundamental frequency bandwidth of the song structure is important, as failure to do\nso will preclude the detection of some units and may lead to misinterpretation of\nsong structure. When possible, a multiyear review of song, composed of multiple\nindividuals from each year, should be conducted to examine phrase pattern and evolution, which may aid in classification of phrase organization. Although we will not\nattempt to evaluate or provide guidelines on appropriate sampling protocols,\nsampling is as critical with humpback whale song as it is with any other data type\n(e.g., genetic sampling). It is important to optimize both quality of samples (signalto-noise ratio and recording length) and sample size (number of different individuals\nrecorded) to accurately document population level parameters.\nThemes\nA sequence of similar phrases is defined as a theme (Payne and McVay 1971), and\ntherefore a new phrase type within the song sequence initiates a new theme. Individual males may sing different numbers of phrases, both in different themes and in consecutive renditions of the same theme. Thus, the length of any given theme varies\nboth within and between individuals. Frumhoff (1983) classified fundamental themes\nas those present in all songs in at least 90% of the recordings in both a given season\nand at least one contiguous season. This concept was driven by the idea that thematic\norder is fixed (and “aberrant” songs strayed from that order when “fundamental”\nthemes were omitted). Other authors have classified “fundamental” themes as those\npresent in 95% of all recordings within one season (Chu and Harcourt 1986). Due to\nthe evolving nature of humpback song, the concept of a fundamental theme is\nephemeral.\nPayne and Payne (1985) further classified themes into three different types based\non their organization: (1) Static themes are those with a sequence of nearly identical\nphrases. (2) Shifting themes are those in which successive phrases evolve progressively\nfrom one form to another. Units may gradually change in frequency and/or form,\nduration, or number of subunits, or be delivered at a slower or faster rate (i.e., variation in interunit interval). Phrases may evolve such that changes are progressive, systematic and irreversible with each successive repetition. (3) Unpatterned themes are\nthose in which a variable number of units have no clear organization and thus cannot\nbe subdivided into repeating phrases. The result is a theme composed of one single,\nlong phrase. (Another type of one-phrase theme noted by Payne and McVay (1971)\noccurs when a single phrase is composed of unique material that does not resemble\nthe previous or next theme but yet occurs consistently.) It should be noted that unpatterned themes appear to be rare, occurring only twice in the cumulative experience\nof the authors (DMC, RSS-L and SC, unpublished data).\nThe classification of fundamental themes has not been widely adopted in the literature. The categorization of themes into types has also not been widespread, but Payne\nand Payne’s (1985) proposition of static, shifting, and unpatterned themes does\ncharacterize humpback whale singing behavior across many regions and years (DMC,\nRSS-L and SC, unpublished data).\nE320 MARINE MAMMAL SCIENCE, VOL. 29, NO. 3, 2013\nBecause song is constantly undergoing progressive temporal change, the processes\nby which changes occur can have a profound effect on the structure and classification\nof song elements. An exploration of all such processes is beyond the scope of this\npaper, but examples reported in the literature exemplify the phenomenon and underscore the need for consideration of progressive change during classification. Several\nstudies have documented gradual change within and between years (Payne et al.\n1983; Cerchio et al. 2001; Eriksen et al. 2005) and have endeavored to maintain the\nnomenclature for phrases and themes across time despite changes. We emphasize that\nit is important to maintain the integrity of phrase/theme “lineages” when conducting\nstudies of similarity across time, so as not to confuse the evolution of existing phrases\nwith the introduction of new material (completely different phrases).\nConversely, in some cases, different variants of the same phrase type (as defined\nabove) that are present in the same song and sung in an inconsistent and interchangeable sequence may be indicative of the evolution of a new “theme” (Payne et al.\n1983). Cerchio (1993) and Cerchio et al. (2001) noted that such instances represented\nthe splitting of a theme and “birth” of a new theme over multiple seasons. In the\nschematic example represented in Table 1, two variants of the same phrase existed in\nyear 1. They shared their second subphrase (d), but their first subphrase represented\nvariants (a or b). They were uttered interchangeably and were considered part of the\nsame theme. In year 2, each variant had evolved and diverged, but subphrase “d” was\nstill similar between the two. The phrase types were no longer sung interchangeably,\nbut had become clearly sequential as typical of consecutive static themes. At this\npoint, they appeared to be treated as two distinct themes. By year 3, subphrase “d”\nhad been dropped completely from the second phrase type, and the two phrases (and\nconsequently, themes) no longer showed any similarity to one another. In this case,\nthe change in phrase structure occurred at the subphrase level. In an analysis of song\npattern, Cerchio et al. (2001) designated themes in such a way as to follow the changing pattern in subphrase modifications. This convention may reveal rules of change\nover extended periods of time and extensive geographic scales.\nWe suggest that the definition of a theme be clarified to emphasize subphrase\nstructure, such that a theme is a repetition of phrases that have similar subphrases in\ncommon. Between two phrase types, when one subphrase is similar but another subphrase is consistently different (called “rhyming” phrases in Guinee and Payne 1988),\na new theme should be designated based on the sequence consistency of the structural\nchange.\nCare should be taken in classifying themes when comparing songs from different\nregions or time periods. When multiyear samples are available, continuity in naming\nTable 1. Example of structural changes occurring at the subphrase level, resulting in the\nsplitting of a single theme into two themes over a 3 yr period. In this schematic representation, subphrase type is indicated by a lower case letter (a, b, or d) and temporal change in the\ninternal structure of the subphrase across seasons is indicated by a prime (a ? a’ ? a”). This\nprocess was observed in two sets of themes reported in Cerchio et al. (2001), themes 2A/2B\nand 3A/3B leading up to the year that was analyzed in that study.\nYear Phrase type 1 Phrase type 2 Example sequence\n1 ad bd …-ad-ad-ad-bd-bd-ad-ad-bd-…\n2 a’d’ b’d’ …-a’d’-a’d’-a’d’- b’b’b’d’-b’b’b’d’-…\n3 a”d” b” …-a”d”-a”d”-a”d”-b”-b”-b”-b”-…\nREVIEW ARTICLE E321\namong years should be maintained, so that an individual “lineage” of a theme/phrase\ntype may be followed over time. Similar themes in different adjacent regions (i.e.,\nwhere the potential for acoustic interaction exists) should be labeled as such, regardless of their position within the song sequence or the presence or absence of other\nthemes. In one study (Maeda et al. 2000), what appeared to be similar themes in two\ndifferent regions were mistakenly treated as different themes; the analyses of theme\npresence and evolution were therefore incomparable between the two regions, complicating interpretation of the results.\nSong\nA sequence of themes comprises a song, according to the definition proposed by Payne and McVay (1971). This description was further developed by Frumhoff (1983),\nwho described a song as a series of at least three themes, organized in a predictable\nsequence, repeated in the same order two or more times. The choice of the theme that\nstarts the “song” cycle is considered arbitrary, since males usually sing in a continuous\nbout without stopping between repeated cycles (e.g., in one famous example, Winn\nand Winn (1978) report having recorded a humpback whale singing for 22 h). The\nuse of this definition of song will be discussed in detail in the following section.\nDiscussion of the Hierarchical Level of Song in Humpback whales\nVariation in Sequence Consistency\nEarly studies suggested that humpback song patterns were produced in a fixed and\nordered sequence (i.e., a male would sing themes 1 to 2 to 3 and then repeat the same\nsequence). This observation led to the conclusion that a hierarchical structure existed\n200\n400\n600\nFrequency (Hz)\n800\nTime (minutes:seconds)\n00:00 10:00 20:00 3 50:00 0:00 40:00 60:00\n0\n200\n400\n600\n800\n0\n00:00 10:00 20:00 30:00 40:00 50:00\nA\nB\nFigure 3.

However, detailed reviews of the\nliterature reveal that the stereotypy of theme order may vary considerably among and\nwithin individuals, or between years. Frumhoff (1983) coined the term “aberrant\nsong session” as one in which a song cycle varied from the “current” norm; specifically, when two themes that are usually separated by a fundamental theme are sung\nin succession. In general, this was considered uncommon.\nLater work, however, suggested a higher degree of variation in theme order. In a\nsmall sample of songs recorded in Mexico and Hawaii during 1989–1990, Helweg\net al. (1990, 1992) reported that the sequence of themes in the songs they recorded\nwas variable (including some theme “reversals”), and suggested that all of their\nsamples would be described as “aberrant” by Frumhoff’s classification. Cato (1991)\nmentioned the existence of “poorly structured” songs in Australia in some years, and\nin a separate study of South Pacific song (Helweg et al. 1998), theme deletions were\nobserved, but theme reversals were not. Additionally, in a multiyear comparison of\nsong evolution in Tonga, Eriksen et al.

(A) Continuous recordings of five males from Kauai, Hawaii, in 1991\nwere combined for approximately 7 h of theme sequence analysis. Themes are labeled by\nsequential numbers and letters. There were a total of 197 theme transitions; thematic sequence\nmay be considered “highly invariant,” as 96% of thematic transitions follow the predicted\norder. (B) Continuous recordings of five males from Isla Socorro, Mexico in 2004 were combined for 5.8 h of theme sequence analysis. Themes were designated by letters, to avoid any\nunintentional bias associated with designating themes by sequential numbers. There were a\ntotal of 150 theme transitions; thematic sequence was quite variable in this year. Some theme\ntransitions were extremely rare or nonexistent, while others were prominent. However, a clear\ncyclical pattern is not observed, as reversals between themes B & G, O & B, and B & Y are\ncommon.\nREVIEW ARTICLE E323\ntransitions was not consistent from year to year. Although they do not provide data\nto quantify the number of seemingly “aberrant” song cycles, they graphically demonstrate that the song sequence in particular years of their sample is more variable than\nothers, including a higher degree of theme “reversals” in certain years.\nA multiyear study of humpback whale breeding behavior conducted off of Isla\nSocorro, Mexico, has also resulted in the compilation of many hours of recordings of\nsinging males across years. Recordings of multiple males in 2004 suggest greater variability in theme order than typically expected, or documented in adjacent years\n(DMC, unpublished data; Smith-Aguilar 2009). Rather than singing each theme in\nan ordered sequence, males recorded in this period often switch back and forth\nbetween themes, including a higher degree of “theme reversals” than previously\nreported (Fig. 4).\nIn this situation, defining what constitutes a “song” by the classic definition is\nextremely difficult. There appears to be no clear, overarching sequence that all males\nin that region and time period followed while singing. This is not to say that the\nsequence of themes is random—in fact, examination of the transitions between\nthemes reveals that some transitions are common (e.g., the transition from theme\nB ? G, or theme O ? B; Fig. 4), while others are absent (e.g., there is never a transition from theme B ? N; Fig. 4). The difference in the loosely structured pattern of\nsongs from males in the Mexico sample, and those singing a more traditionally\nordered song, is both visually evident (Fig. 3) and quantifiable (Fig. 4).\nWithout more detailed study, it is impossible to say whether the variability in\ntheme order observed in the songs of males recorded in Mexico 2004 is a short-term\nphenomenon or whether it is indicative of a larger-scale process. In an extensive,\nlong-term study conducted on song evolution over many years, Payne and Payne\n(1985) found that occasionally, the song in a particular year seemed anomalous when\ncompared to previous and subsequent seasons. Similarly, Cato (1991) also found that\nin some years, song was more poorly structured than others. Possibly, the variability\nobserved in the Mexico 2004 sample can be attributed to a period of rapid song evolution, or it may reflect a broader cycle of the ebb and flow of stereotypy across years.\nHowever, regardless of the underlying reason for this variability, its existence (here\nand in other samples, e.g., Eriksen et al. 2005) suggests that, in at least some cases, a\ndifferent method of considering humpback whale song may be appropriate.\nHumpbacks as “Eventual Variety” Singers: An Avian Comparison\nThere exists terminology in the avian literature that seems to effectively describe\nthe humpback song system. Scholars of avian behavior defined bird song as a series of\nnotes, uttered in such a way as to form a recognizable sequence (Thorpe 1961;\nBremond 1963), in which the pauses between notes were shorter than the pauses\nbetween songs (Isaac and Marler 1963, Thielcke 1969). Variations on these patterns\nare called song types. Payne and McVay (1971) drew on this literature when developing their terminology, but equated the entire sequence of themes sung by a humpback whale to a song sung by a bird.\nHowever, we suggest that humpback phrases and bird songs are analogous. Early\nscholars of avian song noted different modes of singing behavior, in which an individual may repeat the same song type many times before switching to a different song\ntype (e.g., AAA BBB CCC), or switch immediately between different song types in\nhis repertoire with each consecutive song (e.g., ABCABCABC, Hartshorne 1956).\nThe difference between these modes of singing is often distinguished in the literature\nE324 MARINE MAMMAL SCIENCE, VOL. 29, NO. 3, 2013\nas “eventual variety” or “repeat” singing, and “immediate variety” or “serial” singing\n(Molles and Vehrencamp 1999). These terms may also be used at lower levels of song\norganization (for example to describe repetition of syllables within songs), but we\nrefer here to their use in describing higher patterns of song presentation. Within the\n“eventual variety” category, variation may exist between repeats of the same song\ntype, but this variation is less than that between song types (Stoddard et al. 1988,\nAnderson et al. 2008).\nNot all species fit neatly into one category or the other, in fact there are a wide\nrange of song presentation strategies. Some species may not consistently repeat all\nsong types, and the degree of repetition may vary greatly between individuals (Eens\net al. 1989). Other species exhibit complex rules for deciding when to repeat song\ntypes (Todt and Hultsch 1996). Still others sing extremely long, complex songs, in\nwhich even discerning the pattern is challenging, requiring detailed review of syllabic\norganization (Catchpole 1976).\nHowever, within the broad categories of singing modes, the repeated phrases of\nhumpback song, especially those in “static” themes, would seem to fit well into the\n“eventual variety” category. In fact, the archetypical song structure described by Payne\nand McVay (1971) can be considered a specific case of eventual variety singing, in which\na singer utters several repetitions of each phrase in his repertoire, passing from one type\nto another in an invariable order, until he has sung his complete repertoire, and then\nstarts over again without pause. Variations in this paradigm have confounded several\ninvestigators and analyses since the original description, and may be better accommodated when consideredin thelarger paradigm of “eventual variety” singing behavior.\nAvian studies that address eventual variety songsters may include analyses of variables such as degree of repetitivity and switching rate—factors shown to be important in interindividual interactions (Molles and Vehrencamp 1999, Molles 2006).\nStudies of species with more complex song systems incorporate many additional techniques to evaluate song organization, such as syllable organization (Catchpole 1976)\nor Euclidean distance between songs (Sorjonen 1987). In contrast, most humpback\nsong studies considering the biological significance of song sequence have focused on\nthe broadest level, examining features such as “song duration” (i.e., duration of the\nentire thematic sequence).\nThe Problem with Measuring “Song Duration”\nBesides limiting the scope of our analyses, why is the present use of the hierarchical\nlevel of humpback “song” a problem? Consider the case in which the duration of a\n“song” is used as a quantitative metric to evaluate the impact of potential acoustic\ndisturbance to singing whales (e.g., low-frequency active sonar experiments: Miller\net al. 2000, Fristrup et al. 2003). Fristrup et al. (2003) used a straightforward method\nto delineate sequential songs: a song was measured as the interval between successive\nstarts of a particular theme (that which was traditionally associated with surfacing),\nwithout respect to theme order beyond this “marker” theme. The authors measured\n“song duration” ranging from 5.5 min to over 33 min in length, and conclude that\nalthough songs in general increased in duration in response to the acoustic disturbance, song length was highly variable. Another study (Miller et al. 2000) generally\nagreed that singing humpbacks increased the length of their songs in relation to\nbroadcasts of low-frequency active sonar. Conversely, in a separate study, Sousa-Lima\net al. (2002) used the number of phrases per theme to assess differences in song length\nbetween songs of males before and during boats approaches, and found that song\nREVIEW ARTICLE E325\nlength decreased in response to acoustic disturbance. Given that these studies were all\ntrying to evaluate the potential impact of anthropogenic activity on singing behavior,\none might question how to interpret their opposing results.\nInterpretation of such changes in song length relative to a stimulus is strongly\ndependent on the variability of theme order and occurrence in the sequence of\nthemes defined as a song. If theme order is invariant and all themes occur in each\ncycle of the “song,” then a measure of “song duration” as currently defined can be\ninformative, because each repetition through the cycle includes the same number of\nthemes. We can predict that longer songs are achieved in one of several ways\n(e.g., by increasing the length of particular units or phrases, by increasing the number of phrase repetitions in the theme, etc.). Therefore, it is possible that a “longer\nsong” is the result of singers increasing the number of repetitions of phrases within\n(a) theme(s). Conversely, if theme order and occurrence is variable among consecutive “songs,” then it is also possible that males might sing a more “erratic” song, in\nwhich they switch back and forth before completing a cycle (i.e., returning to the\ntheme arbitrarily chosen as the song “beginning” without uttering all themes in a\nsequence). Knowing what type of response led to an increase in “song duration,” as\nwell as knowing what constituted a typical “song,” would be critical in interpreting\nthe mechanism of the singers’ reaction. Biologically, these differences suggest distinct responses to acoustic interference, but none of the studies presented data on\nvariability in thematic composition, nor attempted to quantify the underlying\nreasons for the large variation or observed change in “song” duration.\nIn general, when theme order is less stable, consistently defining a sequence that\ncomprises a “song,” and consequently measuring “song length,” becomes difficult.\nConsider the following example of an actual theme sequence recorded in Brazil 2002\n(Sousa-Lima 2007), when six themes were clearly identified:\n...1234124546123465461234546121246...\nWe may arbitrarily set the beginning of the song to “Theme 1.” If we delineate\nsongs in this sample based on the requirement that a “song” includes a complete rendition of all themes, our song sequence would be as follows:\n...1234124546=12346546=1234546=121246...\nIf instead we used Frumhoff’s (1983) definition, our “song” could be categorized\nby the repetition of themes 1-2-3 (since this pattern is repeated more than twice in\nthe song session), perhaps leading to the following:\n...1234124546=12346546=1234546121246...\nOr, following the precedent of the Fristrup et al. (2003) study, we could start a\nnew song each time we encounter Theme 1. Thus our song sequence would be as follows:\n...1234=124546=12346546=1234546=12=1246...\nAlthough each of the above examples uses the exact same thematic sequence, different methods of delineating song structure (each published and utilized in different\nstudies) lead to very different results in terms of the number of “songs” in the\nE326 MARINE MAMMAL SCIENCE, VOL. 29, NO. 3, 2013\nsequence, in the measured duration of each song, and in the thematic composition\nand order in each song. As a result, attempts to derive biologically relevant interpretations from analyses at the “song” level become difficult at best, and interpretation\nof the results is impossible without description of the variability of theme order. This\nreal example demonstrates that the definition of “song,” and consequently the metric\nof “song duration,” as currently measured for humpback whales is in some cases problematic, and raises the question as to the biological interpretation of analyses conducted at this hierarchical level.\nThis is not to say that measures of song cycles, as classically defined for humpback\nwhales, are without significance. When theme order is invariant, dividing sequences\ninto song cycles for analyses may be relevant because the “songs” being compared are\ntrue repeats of the same pattern. And clearly, in at least some years, male humpback\nwhales do seem to adhere to a hierarchical sequence at this level, which seems likely\nto be biologically relevant. However, when individuals incorporate a larger degree of\nvariation into their thematic sequence, trying to force this variation into a structure\nthat is defined by ordered repetition is not appropriate. The outcome is a series of\narbitrarily delineated “songs,” none of which is like the other.\nA final note on song designation: while breathing intervals have sometimes been\nused as a “convenient way to define a beginning and end” of a song (Winn et al.\n1970, Payne and Payne 1985), our own observations as well as other studies (Winn\nand Winn 1978, Winn et al. 1981), document individuals breathing during different\nthemes, so the temptation to use breathing cycle as a measure of “song length” should\nbe avoided.\nApplication of Songbird Metrics to Humpback Whale Song\nFrom a biological perspective, the degree of variation in theme order may be informative. However, many researchers choose to assess effects at the song cycle level, and\nthese potentially relevant differences in singing behavior are consequently ignored.\nRegrettably, this is likely limiting our understanding of the use of song within the\nhumpback mating system. Instead, if we expand our conceptual framework to learn\nfrom studies of song in other taxa, we can consider humpback whales as “eventual\nvariety” singers, and apply established methods for assessing variation and effects\nwithin this different paradigm. Some authors have started to move towards quantifying song structure at the level of phrases or repetitions of phrases (Eriksen et al. 2005,\nTougaard and Eriksen 2006, Cholewiak 2008).\nRecent work (Cholewiak 2008) to apply some of the avian song metrics to analyses of humpback whale song have found that males do vary their song presentation\nin ways that are quantifiable on the level of phrase-based analyses. For example, an\nanalysis of switching rate found that males significantly increase the rate at which\nthey switch between different phrase types in the presence of a second singer, as\ncompared to when they are alone (Cholewiak 2008). This type of analysis provides\ndifferent and potentially more revealing information than may be obtained, for\nexample from traditional transition matrices or measures of “song” duration. The\nuse of similar metrics in songbirds has revealed that changes in these variables may,\nfor example, indicate an escalation of aggression between males (Krebs et al. 1981,\nVehrencamp 2001). Further applications of these types of methods to humpback\nwhale songs, such as using quantitative metrics to measure the degree of repetition\nover time rather than across song cycles, may be important in advancing our understanding of the complex nature of humpback whale vocal behavior.\nREVIEW ARTICLE E327\nConclusions and Recommendations\nInvestigations of humpback whale song have spanned over four decades, yet there\nare still many unanswered questions regarding the degree of variation within and\nbetween individuals, the ways in which changes in song structure are transmitted\nover space and time, and the role of song within the breeding system. Pioneering\nwork in the 1970s and 1980s developed a framework within which to analyze and\nunderstand humpback song structure, which was later reinforced and expanded by\nfurther studies. Humpback whale song is a constantly changing phenomenon, which\nhas captured the interest of many students of animal behavior, while also presenting\nchallenges with respect to qualitative and quantitative analyses.\nAt the lower hierarchical levels within the humpback song framework, traditional\ndefinitions have worked well to identify song elements for analyses. At the middle\nlevels, however, delineation of “phrases” and “themes” has been complicated both by\nthe lack of well-defined time intervals between repetitive sequences, as well as by the\never-changing nature of song features. At the highest hierarchical level within this\nframework, the application of song cycle measures has obscured the degree of variation in theme order that exists between males, and has made interpretation and comparison of studies using different classification schemes problematic at best. While\nindividuals have been shown to often sing themes in a relatively fixed order, it\nappears that in some regions (and/or time periods) there is variation in the consistency\nwith which individual males adhere to a strict sequence. In the majority of studies to\ndate, the potential biological relevance of this variability has been overlooked, because\nit is difficult to quantify within the traditional framework. In these situations, we\nsuggest that the measures at the level of “song” (as a fixed sequence of themes) be used\nwith extreme caution, and that alternative analyses be considered. In light of the burgeoning body of work on humpback whale singing behavior, we hope that this\nreview will enable more consistent, meaningful comparisons across studies.\nRecommendations\nGiven the analytical approaches that have become common in studies of humpback\nwhale song, and our assessment of the inherent variation in song behavior and associated problems, we make the following recommendations for studies of humpback\nwhale song patterns:\n(1) Maintaining the use of “units” and “subunits” in song description and measurements.\n(2) Use of a consistent set of criteria for delineation of phrases, as described in this\nreview.\n(3) Maintaining and using vocabulary describing different theme types, as described\nin Payne and Payne (1985).\n(4) Abandonment of the classical use of the “song duration” metric as a response\nvariable, and except in the specific case in which theme order and occurrence\nwithin and between singers is demonstrated to be invariable or nearly invariable.\n(5) Adoption of the “phrase” as the salient level of repetition, as analogous to a bird\n“song” in the avian literature, and consequent exploration of analysis approaches\nthat focus on sequences of phrases, following the birdsong paradigm for analysis\nof song sequences.\nE328 MARINE MAMMAL SCIENCE, VOL. 29, NO. 3, 2013\nAcknowledgments\nThe authors would like to thank Christopher Clark and Sandra Vehrencamp for their mentorship and many fruitful discussions that contributed to ideas captured in this manuscript.\nWe would also like to sincerely acknowledge the many staff of the Bioacoustics Research\nProgram; without their help, much of the work highlighted in this paper would not have been\npossible.

Zoidisb,c\na\nUniversity of Tennessee, Knoxville; b\nCollege of the Atlantic, 105 Eden Street, Bar Harbor, Maine,\n04609 USA; c\nCetos Research Organization, 11 Des Isle Avenue, Bar Harbor, Maine, 04609 USA\n(Received 27 June 2011; final version received 5 February 2012)\nSince the groundbreaking work of Payne and McVay (1971), humpback songs have\nbeen conceptualized in terms of the upward hierarchical organization of sound units\nwithin phrases, and phrases within themes. Songs change within each season and all\nwhales in a geographical region detect and sing the reshaped song. Here we propose\ntwo properties that act to make relearning the evolving song possible. First, each level\nof the hierarchical structure constrains the others. We estimated the degree of constraint\nusing information theory and found that the theme, phrase, and prior sound unit\nreduced the source entropy of the current sound unit equally. Different sound units are\nfound in each theme and phrase; each theme and phrase ‘uses up’ some of the sound\nunits. Second, the rhythm of the sound units acts to simplify the phrase structure. The\ntiming between sound units often separates adjacent phrases by longer silent durations,\nand in spite of huge differences in the number of sound units within phrases, the overall\nduration of the phrases often are equal, allowing the whale to anticipate phrase\nrepetitions. Humpback and human songs share the same hierarchical structure, but\nthere are striking differences in the sound unit sequence.\nKeywords: humpback songs; hierarchical; source entropy; rhythm\nIntroduction\nOver 40 years ago, Payne and McVay (1971) described the hierarchical repetitive songs\nproduced by male humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) on their mating grounds\n(Helwig et al. 1992). Songs are composed of sound units, defined as the “shortest sounds\nthat seem continuous to the human ear” (Payne et al. 1983) and previous research has\nfound between 10 and 30 different sound units within a song (Mercado et al. 2005; Suzuki\net al. 2006). Sound units are short (,4 s) and nearly always separated by at least 0.50 s.\nSongs characteristically change within each season and that change is contagious; all\nwhales within the area track and sing the reshaped song (Eriksen et al. 2005). Given the\nlong involved song, it is not clear how the whales are even able to detect that the song has\nevolved. Here we propose two properties that act to simplify learning the sound sequence\nand that act to accentuate changes in the song.\nHierarchical organization\nSound units can be grouped into phrases (Payne et al. 1983).1 In all geographical\npopulations, nearly all phrases are composed of four or less different sound units and are\nISSN 0952-4622 print/ISSN 2165-0586 online\nq 2012 Taylor & Francis\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09524622.2012.668324\nhttp://www.tandfonline.com\n*Corresponding author. Email: stephen.handel@gmail.com\nBioacoustics\niFirst article, 2012, 1–16\nDownloaded by [Stephen Handel] at 15:29 01 April 2012 \nless than six sound units in length. Typical phrases are repetitions of a single sound, simple\nrepeating sequences of two or more sound units, e.g. (ab) or (abc), or more complex\nphrases in which the number of repeating elements or alternations is more variable, e.g.\n(aabbc) or (aabbaabab) (Winn and Winn 1978). Phrases usually repeat at least once before\ntransforming into another phrase that normally shares some of the same sound units. In\nturn, the phrases can be grouped into themes on the basis of common sounds. Themes are\norganized into a cyclical pattern termed a song that may be repeated several times within a\nsong session (Winn and Winn 1978; Payne et al. 1983).\nRecent analyses have demonstrated that the sound unit sequence is highly constrained,\nmeasured by the ‘source entropy’ or the uncertainty of the sound unit sequence. The source\nentropy measured using a one-step Markov estimator (t þ 1j t) was roughly 1.0 bit per\nsound for mating songs along the coast of Hawaii (Suzuki et al. 2006) and for migrating\nwhales off the coast of Australia (Miksis-Olds et al. 2008). Further analyses by Suzuki\net al. (2006) and Miksis-Olds et al. (2008) demonstrated that the predictability of the sound\nunit sequence extended beyond the previous unit\nOne approach to understanding that predictability is by considering the following\nfactors: (1) the source entropy at each level of the song as well as interrelationships among\nthe hierarchical levels of the song; (2) the source entropy of the phrase sequence\nconditioned by the themes; and (3) and the source entropy of the sound unit sequence\nconditioned by the themes and phrases. The ability of an individual whale to detect a change\nin a song depends on a perceived framework created by the transitions among the individual\nsound units, phrases, and themes and the sounds found within phrases, and the phrases\nfound within themes. The highly constrained organization is a way to simplify the learning,\nproduction and perception of the song. A wide range of species implicitly learns the\nstatistical dependencies in strings of nonlinguistic sounds (Saffran et al. 2007) and we\nwould expect the same ability would allow humpbacks to learn and detect subsequent\nchanges in a complex song composed of sound units with very different timbres.\nGreen et al. (2011) have shown that there are recurrent bigrams, i.e. a sequence of two\nsound units, in humpback songs across years. These bigrams are best characterized in terms\nof relative acoustic properties between the two sounds rather than the properties of the\nindividual sounds themselves. While the properties relating two sounds may be difficult to\ndescribe, one predictable bigram occurs when two sounds repeat, and while all songs\ncontain repeated sounds, not all sounds are repeated. Such restrictions may be based on\nproduction constraints, and create anchor points to learn the song and govern the ways that\nthe song can be composed.\nRhythmic organization\nWe suggest two roles for the rhythmic structure that underscore the theme and phrase\nsequence and enhance the predictability of the sound unit sequence. First, the rhythm\naccentuates the phrases and themes by changing the timing between sounds, termed figural\norganization, so that some sound units are grouped together. Figural grouping has been\nidentified in the calls of killer whales (Shapiro et al. 2011), passerine birds (Philesturnus\ncarunculatus) (Jenkins 1977), and zebra finches (Williams and Staples 1992). Second, the\nrhythm creates a temporal ‘grid’, termed metric organization, so that phrases and themes\nare perceived to repeat at equal intervals independent of the kind of sound unit or the\nnumber of sound units (McAuley 2010).\nBoth rhythmic structures emphasize the repeating phrase and theme organization.\nThus, if the sound unit sequence alternates ababab ... , the figural grouping would be\n2 S. Handel et al.\nDownloaded by [Stephen Handel] at 15:29 01 April 2012 \n(ab)(ab)(ab) or (ba)(ba)(ba) and not (aba)(bab). Similarly, if the sound unit sequence is\naabbaabbaacccaacccaadaad, then the grouping of the sequence into phrases would be\n(aabb)(aabb)(aaccc)(aaccc)(aad)(aad) due to figural organization and the temporal interval\nbetween the onsets of the initial ‘a’ in each figural group would be equal due to the metric\norganization. The silent intervals between the ‘a’s and ‘c’s in the phrase (aaccc) would be\nshortened and the silent intervals within the phrase (aac) would be lengthened.\nPresent research\nThe results described here illustrate that the phrases found in each theme differ and the\nsounds found in each phrase differ so that each level of the hierarchy constrains the other.\nIdentifying a sound unit tells the whale not only what the next sound is likely to be, but\nalso in what phrase and theme that sound is likely to be embedded. Knowing the theme and\nphrase further reduces the uncertainty of the next sound unit. The rhythmic structure\nunderscores that phrase and theme organization.\nMaterial and methods\nWhale songs\nWe analysed three sets of songs recorded on the Hawaiian breeding grounds. In all cases,\nthe sounds were received on custom-built hydrophones using a Sippican transducer\nelement, transmitted by Joslyn or L-tronics radio transceivers (20 kHz bandwidth, with\nequalization filtering to even out frequency response), and digitized and recorded by a\nTEAC RD-135 digital recorder using a sampling rate of 4000 Hz. Songs were recorded in\nwaters either off the northwest coast of the island of Kauai, Hawaii (1994) or in the\nchannel between Maui and Lanai (1999 and 2001) by Cetos Research Organization. The\nrecordings were collected under NOAA permit 1039–1699.\nThe first set of three songs, recorded in March 1994, is found in the MobySound\narchives (Mellinger and Clark 2006) together with details of the recording procedure, and\nthe determination of the start- and end-time of each sound. There is one prominent whale\nsinging in each recording. In the MobySound archive, files names such as 940305-1037\nindicate the year (94), month (03), day of the month (05), and hour and minute (1037) local\nHawaii Time. Songs from three individual whales were identified in the MobySound\narchive based on field notes: Whale 1: 940302-12:22 and 940302-12:37; Whale 2: 940302-\n13:22 through 940302-13:38; and Whale 3: 940305-09:37 through 940305-10:22. The\nsecond set of two songs was recorded in January 1999 and the third set from January 15 to\nFebruary 23, 2001. For all years, each song was recorded from a different whale.\nFinally, a fourth collection utilized a song recorded in the Virgin Islands on February\n14, 1992. The recording was made using a single hydrophone connected to a Sony\nD6C recorder that converted to a 44.1 Hz AIFF file. This song is also available from\nwww.whalelistening.com.\nFor all songs, spectrograms (Gaussian window 0.045 s, 5000 Hz range) were made for\neach sound unit using the PRAAT analysis program (www.Praat.org). The classification\nand onset and offset timing of each sound unit was done aurally and visually from the\nspectrograms and confirmed by a second acoustician.\nThe identification of themes and phrases followed heuristics suggested by Sousa-Lima\n(2007). The identification of phrases was straightforward as phrases tended to repeat\n(e.g. (aabb) (aabb)) or shift to different sounds (e.g. (aabb) (edd)). If the sounds units\nstrictly alternated, found only in the 1994 songs, e.g. ababab ... , each repetition was\nBioacoustics 3\nDownloaded by [Stephen Handel] at 15:29 01 April 2012 \nconsidered a separate phrase (ab) due to the rhythmic structure and the variability in the\nnumber of alternations within a theme. Phrases longer than six or seven sound units were\ntreated as a single theme. Shorter phrases were included in a single theme based on overall\nsimilarities among those phrases.\nStatistical analyses: uncertainty measures\nWe elaborated the use of mutual information and source entropy in two ways. First, it is\npossible to extrapolate the concept of source entropy from the sequence of individual sound\nunits to sequences of themes and phrases. The predictability of the next (tþ1) theme, phrase,\nor sound unit can be measured from the present (t) theme, phrase, or sound unit respectively,\nand the source entropies are the differences between the overall uncertainties of the themes,\nphrases, or sound units and the respective predictable parts. Such predictions and\nuncertainties do not cut across the three hierarchical levels. This generates three parallel\nequations for the source entropy H:\nH ½X ðt þ 1jtÞ\u0001 ¼ H ½X\u0001 2 H ½X ðt þ 1Þ : XðtÞ\u0001 ð1Þ\nwhere X can stand for themes [T], phrases [P], and sounds [S]. The source entropies are the\naverage uncertainties in one variable, when another variable is held constant so that the\nsource entropy of Y given X is the weighted average of the uncertainties of H (Y|X ¼ xi)\nacross all values of xi. Here\nH ½X ðt þ 1jtÞ\u0001 ¼ 2Sp ½X ðtÞ\u0001Sp ½X ðt þ 1jtÞ\u0001log p ½X ðt þ 1jtÞ\u0001 ð2Þ\nor\nH ½X ðt þ 1jtÞ\u0001 ¼ 2S Sp ½X ðt þ 1Þ; XðtÞ\u0001log p ½X ðt þ 1jtÞ\u0001\nH [T], H [P], and H [S] would represent the uncertainties of the distribution of themes,\nphrases, and sound units; H [T (t þ 1):T(t)], H [P (t þ 1):P(t)], and H [S (t þ 1):S(t)] would\nrepresent the mutual information between successive themes, phrases, and sound units\nrespectively; and H [T (t þ 1jt)], H [P (t þ 1jt)], and H [S (t þ 1jt)] would represent the\nsource entropies based on the sequence of themes, phrases, and sound units respectively.\nSecond, for each pair of hierarchical levels, it is possible to measure the source entropy\nof one level conditioned by a second level (McGill 1954; Garner 1962).2 Again, this creates\nthree parallel equations:\nH½Y\u0001 ½X\u0001 ¼ H ½X\u0001 2 H ½X : Y\u0001 ð3Þ\nwhere X and Y represent two hierarchical levels. Here, H[T] [P], H[T] [S], and H[P] [S]\nrepresent the source entropy of phrases given the theme, the source entropy of sound units\ngiven the theme, and the source entropy of sound units given the phrase.\nIt is also possible to further partition the source entropy in terms of the sequence of\nphrases within themes and the sequence of sound units within themes and phrases.\nH½y\u0001 ½X ðt þ 1jtÞ\u0001 ¼ H½y\u0001 ½X\u0001 2 H½y\u0001½X ðt þ 1Þ : XðtÞ\u0001 ð4Þ\nwhere X and Y represent two hierarchical levels. H[T] [P(t þ 1j t)] represent the source\nentropy of phrases based on the preceding phrase within each theme, and H[T] [S (t þ 1jt)]\nand H[P] [S (t þ 1jt)] represent the source entropy of sound units based on the preceding\nsound unit within each theme and phrase respectively.\n4 S. Handel et al.\nDownloaded by [Stephen Handel] at 15:29 01 April 2012 \nJuxtaposing the source entropies within each hierarchical level to the source entropies\nbetween levels may allow us to better understand how the song is constrained and\ntherefore how memory limitations might be minimized. Imagine that a simple song\nconsists of two themes, four phrases, and eight sound units that occur equally often. If the\nphrases and sound units occur randomly then knowledge of the theme and phrase does not\nchange the source entropy of phrases or sound units: H[T] [P], H[T] [S], and H[P] [S] equal\ntwo, three, and three bits respectively. However, if two different sound units occur in each\nphrase and two different phrases occur in each theme, then H[T] [P] ¼ 1 bit, H[T] [S] ¼ 2\nbits, and H[P] [S] ¼ 1 bit because knowing which of the two themes occurred still leaves\ntwo equally probable alternative phrases and four equally probable alternative sound units,\nand knowing which phrase occurred still leaves two equally probable sound units.\nIn general, when specific sound units and sequences define the phrases, the phrases\nwithin each theme and the sound units within each phrase will not overlap exactly, so\nthat knowing the present phrase in one theme or sound unit in one phrase can reduce the\nsource entropy of the next phrase or sound unit. For example, if two phrases repeat and\nalternate within a theme [(aabb)(aabb)(aabb)(aacc)(aacc)(aacc)], then H[T] [P] ¼ 1 bit\nbecause there are two equally likely alternative phrases. But, here the previous phrase\nonly weakly predicts the next phrase; H[T] [P (t þ 1):P(t)] ¼ 0.14 bits so that the source\nentropy H[T] [P (t þ 1jt)] ¼ 0.86 bits. In contrast, if the same two phrases alternate,\n[(aabb)(aacc)(aabb)(aacc)(aabb)(aacc)], the previous phrase perfectly predicts the\nfollowing phrase so that H[T] [P (t þ 1jt)] ¼ 0 bits.\nIn similar fashion, although the source entropy of the sound units, H[P] [S], within the\ntwo phrases (aaabb) and (aabab) are identical, the source entropy of a sound unit given the\nprevious sound, H[P] [S (t þ 1jt)], in (aaabb) (0.95 bits) is far greater than the source\nentropy for (aabab) (0.57 bits) based on a Markov one-step model. Thus, the source\nentropy of the sequence of phrases and sound units within themes and phrases gives further\ninformation about the structure of those hierarchical levels. It would be expected that the\nsource entropy for sound units within phrases would be less than the source entropy within\nthemes because the phrase yields finer resolution.\nTo provide an example, we will use one repetition of the highly structured song of\nWhale 3 recorded in 1994. Each repetition ends with the single ‘ratchet’ ‘R’ sound unit\nthat precedes surfacing and then begins again with the ‘a’ sound unit. The sound unit\nsequence is shown below; the phrases are marked by ( ) and the themes by [ ]. Although\neach phrase is shown once, every phrase is repeated at least twice in the song. In fact, the\nalternation [(ab)] could be repeated more than 25 times (labelled rf in Figure 2 later).\n½ðabÞ\u0001 ½ðcccbbÞðccdbbÞ\u0001 ½ðedÞðeddÞðfedddÞ\u0001 ½ðfghÞðfihÞ\u0001 ½ðjihÞðjikÞ\u0001 ½ðRÞ\u0001\nKnowledge of the theme constrains the maximum number of possible phrases from 11 to 3\nand possible sound units from 12 to 4, and the phrase further constrains the maximum\nnumber of possible sound units to three. The theme, moreover, constrains the sound unit\nsequence; in theme 4, the sound unit ‘f’ is followed only by ‘g’ or ‘i’ and not by ‘e’ as found\nin theme 3.\nIn the following analyses, the uncertainties for themes were done in terms of the\ntransitions between different themes. Each new theme is treated as one occurrence\nregardless of how many phrases or sound units are included in that theme. The uncertainties\nfor phrases also were calculated in terms of the transitions between phrases. Each\noccurrence of a phrase would be counted once regardless of the number of sound units\nBioacoustics 5\nDownloaded by [Stephen Handel] at 15:29 01 April 2012 \nwithin that phrase. In contrast to themes, phrases can (and usually do) repeat so that the\nsound sequence aabbabcabcdddee would consist of four phrases (aabb)(abc)(abc)(dddee).\nIt has been estimated that n rþ1 data points, where n is the number of different themes,\nphrases or sound units and r is the type of Markov process, is the minimum required to\naccurately estimate the mutual information and source entropy, and at least n rþ2 would be\npreferred (Marten and Shields 1994). Here, r ¼ 1 for the prediction of (t) from (t þ 1) and\nr ¼ 2 for the prediction of (t þ 2) from the combination of (t) and (t þ 1). For the\nHawaiian songs, the maximum number of unique sound units was 19 and the minimum\nnumber of recorded sound units in one song was 433; thus, the minimum criterion was met\nfor all songs for r ¼ 1. However, this criterion was not met for H [T (t þ 1jt)],\nH [P (t þ 1jt)], or the two-step prediction of sound units H [S (t þ 2jt þ 1,t)] (see Table 1\nfor exact numbers). For themes, phrases, and sound units, the percentage of the potential\n(t) £ (t þ 1) combinations that actually occurred averaged 17% and for sound units the\npercentage of (t þ 2) £ (t þ 1) £ (t) combinations that occurred was 3%. For the H[T] [P],\nH[T] [S], and H[P] [S] conditional source entropies, the percentage of potential\ncombinations that occurred averaged 20%. For conditional source entropies across\nhierarchical levels where the calculations are based on the sequences of sound units within\nindividual themes and phrases, the number of sound units within each theme or phrase will\nbe far less than the total number of recorded sound units, but at the same time the number\nof unique sound units will also decrease. For the H[T] [S (t þ 1jt)] source entropy, the\npercentage of times the n rþ1 criterion was met for each theme averaged 83%. For the H[P]\n[S (t þ 1jt)] source entropy, the percentage of times the n rþ1 criterion was met for each\nphrase averaged 64%. The instances where the n rþ1 criterion was not met for either the\nthemes or phrases represented only a small fraction of the sounds, averaging 15% across\nthemes and phrases so that the effect of these themes or phrases on the estimation of the\nsource entropies was small.\nIn an attempt to measure the underestimation of the sound unit source entropy due to\nthe smaller than optimal number of samples, we calculated both the H [S (t þ 1jt)] and\nH [S (t þ 2jt þ 1,t)] source entropies for each song repetition within a song session\nfor three separate whales and compared those values to that for the entire song session. The\nH [S (t þ 2jt þ 1,t)] source entropy would be expected to have the maximum\nunderestimation because the number of sounds units is far less than the n 3 criterion. We\nchose the one whale in each year with the greatest number of repetitions: whale 3 in 1994\n(four repetitions), whale 2 in 1999 (three repetitions), and whale 5 in 2001 (two\nrepetitions). For the source entropy H [S (t þ 1jt)] (in bits), the mean for a single repetition\nwas 1.22 compared with 1.42 for the entire session; for the two-step source entropy\nH [S (t þ 2jt þ 1,t)], the mean for a single repetition was 0.61 compared with 0.75 for the\nentire session. The source entropies for the individual repetitions were 15–19% less than\nfor the entire song. Due to the recycling of the song within a song session, we would expect\nthe initial repetitions to increase the source entropy the most and subsequent repetitions to\nhave less effect. Based on these two cases, the degree of underestimation is probably\nconsistent across the hierarchical conditions.\nResults\nDistribution of sounds\nThe songs from the three years recorded in Hawaii have widely different sequences of sound\nunits and resulting phrases. For 1994, the predominant phrases are single alternations\nbetween two sound units. Across the three songs, single alternations combining a roar ‘r’\n6 S.

For these two\nsongs, double alternations, e.g. (rrxx), accounted for 22% of the sound units, longer runs of a\nsingle sound unit ending with a single sound unit, (e.g. {y}x with { } indicating a run of three\nor more identical sound units), accounted for 22% of the sound units, and a more complex\nphrase (ccdde) accounted for 14% of the sound units. Examples of different double\nalternation phrases are shown in Figure 2. Still other phrases were found in 2001. Here, a\nsingle grunt ‘g’ preceded repeating runs of identical sound units that in turn were followed\nby two softer sound units ‘kk’. Invariably the initial runs were composed of ‘r’ sound units\nthat transformed into runs of short yip-like sound units ‘y’. These are illustrated in the two\npanels in Figure 3 and accounted for 49% of the sounds. Finally, the phrases found in Virgin\nIslands again differed. These phrases were composed of short yip-like sound units ‘y’,\nsimilar to those found in 2001 in Hawaii, that end with two longer sound units with a\ndownward then upward frequency trajectory, ‘du’. In all cases, the initial phrase was\ncomposed of more than 20 ‘y’s, and then successive phrases contained fewer ‘y’s and the\nlast two or three occurrences contained just four ‘y’s. Every run of ‘y’s ended with the two\n‘du’ sound units and three examples are provided in Figure 4. Overall, the ‘y’ sound units\naccounted for 46% of the sounds.\nSource entropy of Hawaiian songs\nThe uncertainty of themes, phrases, and sound units and the respective source entropies\nboth within each hierarchical level and between levels is given in Table 1. In addition, the\nnumber of sounds in each song, the number of unique themes, phrases and sound units is\nlisted for each of the 11 songs. In what follows, we will consider the source entropy within\none hierarchical level first, and then across the levels. Differences between years will be\nconsidered within each section.\nThemes\nThe number of unique themes ranged from six to 10 and the number of times the theme\nchanged ranged from 11 to 49 (by necessity, themes cannot repeat) although there was no\nrelationship between the number of unique themes and the number of times the themes\nchanged. Across the songs, the uncertainty of the themes (Mean ^ SD) was 2.88 ^ 0.31\nbits and the source entropy given the previous theme was 0.43 ^ 0.22 bits. There was no\ndifference in the uncertainty of the themes or the source entropy across the three years.\nFigure 1. The (r(oar)f) theme typical of songs recorded in 1994 in Hawaii.\n8 S. Handel et al.\nDownloaded by [Stephen Handel] at 15:29 01 April 2012 \nPhrases\nThere are a high percentage of phrase repetitions in all songs. For 1994, 1999, and 2001,\nthe percentages of phrase repetitions were 73%, 62%, and 57%. The number of sound units\nper phrase nearly tripled from 1994 to 2001 (2.7, 4.9, 7.1) reflecting the change from\nsimple alternation phrases to more complex ones involving the repetition of several sounds\nwithin a single phrase. Across the songs, the uncertainty of the phrases was 3.58 ^ 0.51\nbits and the source entropy given the previous phrase was 0.78 ^ 0.18 bits. Yet, as found\nfor themes, there were no differences in the uncertainties of the phrases or the source\nentropies across years despite the disparate phrases in each year.\nSound units\nBetween 1994 and 2001, the number of unique sound units ranged from 11 to 19.As found\nfor phrases, there is a tendency for the same sound unit to repeat although there was a\nstriking difference in this tendency between 1994 (15%), 1999 (49%) and 2001 (54%). In\naddition, the percentage of times three successive sound units were identical was 17% for\n1999 but 33% for 2001.This difference is due to the single alternation phrases (e.g. (rfrf))\nfound in 1994 but not found in the subsequent years, and the long runs of identical sound\nFigure 2. Four phrases recorded in 1999 in Hawaii. Each of the phrases repeat several times before\ntransforming into a different phrase also beginning with the double r(oar)r(oar) sounds. These four\nphrases form one theme.\nBioacoustics 9\nDownloaded by [Stephen Handel] at 15:29 01 April 2012 \nunits found in 2001 but not 1999. Across the songs, the uncertainty of the sound units\naveraged 3.34 ^ 0.26 bits and the source entropy given the previous sound unit was\n1.36 ^ 0.21 bits. The redundancy of each song, defined as [1- (H [S (t þ 1jt)]/Hmax)],\nwhere Hmax equals log2 (number of unique sounds), was 0.66 ^ 0.05.Although there were\nno differences among the uncertainty distributions of the songs, the source entropy was\ngreater for the 1999 songs than for the other two years (ANOVA: F2,8 ¼ 7.81, P , 0.02).\nThe greater source entropy for 1999 was due to the high percentage of double alternation\nsequences (e.g. [rrxx]). Given either sound unit, there is no reduction in the uncertainty of\nthe following sound; it is still 1 bit.\nThe source entropy for the r ¼ 2 Markov process (i.e. predicting S (t þ 2) from the\ncombination of S (t þ 1) and S (t)) reduced the source entropy to 0.77 ^ 0.13 bits, and the\nredundancy increased to 0.81 ^ 0.03. The maximum reduction occurs for the 1999 songs\nFigure 3. Two phrases recorded in 2001 in Hawaii. Each phrase repeats many times at every\noccurrence and the (g{r}kk) phrase always precedes the (g{y}kk) phrase in the song. The (g{r}kk)\nphrase and the (g{y}kk) phrase are considered different themes due to the length of each phrase and\nthe outcome that each one repeats many times.\nFigure 4. Three examples of the ({y(ip)} (du)(du)) phrases found in the Virgin Island song.\nFour themes based on the number of successive ‘y’s were identified: (a) more than 20; (b) 16–20;\n(c) 10–16; (d) less than 10.\n10 S. Handel et al.\nDownloaded by [Stephen Handel] at 15:29 01 April 2012 \nbecause knowing the previous two sound units allows for perfect prediction of the double\nalternation sequences.\nTheme: phrase\nThe average conditional source entropy for phrases given the theme is 0.98 ^ 0.52 bits, a\nsharp reduction from the uncertainty of phrases of 3.58 bits. There was no difference in the\nsize of the reduction across the three years although the source entropy was significantly\ngreater for the 1999 songs (ANOVA: F2,8 ¼ 11.3, P , 0.01). Given the theme and\nprevious phrase, the mean source entropy for the following phrase is slightly reduced,\n0.76 ^ 0.15 bits, but there are four songs in which the source entropy actually increased.\nThis latter outcome was due to the added uncertainty when the previous phrase was at the\nend of one theme and the following phrase was at the beginning of the next theme.\nTheme: sound unit and phrase: sound unit\nThe most important conditional source entropies concern the degree to which themes and\nphrases constrain the occurrence of the sound units. Both the theme and phrase reduce the\nsound unit source entropy for all songs. The phrase reduces the source entropy slightly\nmore than the theme; for all 11 songs the conditional source entropy was greater given the\ntheme (1.51 ^ 0.17 bits) than given the phrase (1.19 ^ 0.06 bits).\nGiven the theme and phrase, knowledge of the previous sound unit further\ndecreases the source entropy of the present sound unit for all songs. The source\nentropy given the theme and previous sound unit was 0.98 ^ 0.17 bits and given the\nphrase and sound unit it was 0.75 ^ 0.16 bits. In all 11 songs, the source entropy given\nthe phrase and previous sound unit was less than the source entropy given the theme\nand previous sound unit.\nConsidering the six terms involving the source entropy for sound units, the rank order\nof (1) H[T] [S]; (2) H [S (t þ 1jt)]; (3) H[P] [S]; (4) H[T] [S (t þ 1)jt]; (5) H[P] [S (t þ 1)jt];\nand (6) H [S (t þ 2)jt þ 1,t] was nearly invariant across the 11 whale songs. A two-way,\nsource entropy condition by whale, ANOVA indicated that the six conditions were\nsignificantly different (ANOVA: F5,50 ¼ 85.67, P , 0. 0001). A series of post-hoc Tukey\nHonestly Different tests identified three groups of source entropies. The first contains H[T]\n[S], H[P] [S], and H [S (t þ 1jt)] source entropies. For these terms, the source entropy\nranges from 1.19 to1.51 bits. The theme, phrase, and previous sound unit reduce the\npresent sound unit uncertainty equally. The second contains H[T] [S (t þ 1jt)], with a mean\nof 0.98 bits. The third contains H[P] [S (t þ 1jt)], and H [S (t þ 2jt þ 1,t)] with means of\n0.75 bits and 0.77 bits. The source entropy is reduced given the theme and previous sound\nunit and minimized given the phrase and previous sound unit or the two previous sound\nunits. These trading relationships among the themes, phrases, and previous sound units\nillustrate the interconnectedness of themes, phrases and sounds.\nSource entropy of the Virgin Islands song\nRegardless of the very different themes and phrases, the pattern of source entropies for the\nsingle song recorded in the Virgin Islands closely mirrored that of the Hawaiian songs.\nOverall, the source entropies were smaller, a result of the long runs of the ‘y’ sounds.\nNonetheless the rank order of the source entropies matched that of the Hawaiian songs\nwith one single minor reversal between H[P] [S (t þ 1jt)], and H [S (t þ 2jt þ 1,t)], and the\nsplit among the six uncertainties also occurred, but to a smaller degree.\nBioacoustics 11\nDownloaded by [Stephen Handel] at 15:29 01 April 2012 \nWe initially noted that these differences might be an arbitrary consequence of a single\nsong analysed for this region. However, to compensate for the long runs of the ‘y’, we\nrecoded those runs based on the number of ‘y’ elements. Runs of 20 or more ‘y’s were\nrecoded into the single sound unit ‘y20’ and, in the same fashion, runs of 16–20, 10–15,\nand 4–9 ‘y’s were recoded into the single sound units ‘y16’, ‘y10’, and ‘y4’ respectively.\nAfter this change, the magnitudes of all the source entropies correspond closely to those\nfound for the Hawaii songs in Table 1.\nRhythmic organization of Hawaii songs\nFigural organization\nThe rhythm within a song provides a set of timed slots, or reference points, into which\nsounds can be attached. The timing of the onset of the sound units creates a rhythmic\nstructure that segments the sound units into coherent groups separated by longer silent\ndurations between the offset of one sound unit and the onset of the next sound unit. Handel\net al. (2009) showed that the silent interval following the offset of one sound unit can vary\ndramatically depending on the phrase and that the duration of the silent intervals did\nsegment the sound units into temporal groups corresponding to phrases and themes.\nFor example, in 1994 (Figure 1), the silent duration following the ‘f’ sound was roughly\n2.6 times longer than the silent duration following the ‘r’ sound (1.97 ^ 0.22 s versus\n0.75 ^ 0.35 s) resulting in a (rf), not a (fr), rhythmic phrase.\nMetric organization\nRhythm also can create a metric structure, in musical terms, in which the start of\nsuccessive phrases or themes occur at equal time intervals regardless of the number of\nsound units within those themes or phrases. Although the songs from 1999 and 2001 have\nvery different kinds of phrases, the durations of the phrases in both are equal, albeit of\ndifferent length.\nAs described above, the phrases found in 1999 tend to be (rrxx) or (rrx). In the majority\nof cases the initial sound is a low-pitched ‘r(oar)’ found in all the Hawaiian songs and the\nsecond sound ‘x’ varies. Four examples of these kinds of phrases are shown in Figure 2.\nFor all four phrases, the two roar sounds are identical. The total length of the four phrases\ndoes vary (ANOVA: F3,43 ¼ 37.9, P , 0. 001); based on Tukey tests, the (rrww) and\n(rr(sc)(sc)) phrases are identical in duration (Mean ^ SD: 13.0 ^ 0.72 s and 12.6 ^ 0.22 s\nrespectively), the (rryy) phrase is shorter (11.5 s ^ 0.34 s) and the (rr(ratchet)) phrase is\nlonger (13.7 ^ 0.67 s). But, these differences could have been greater if not for the\nrhythmic compensation: the silent durations surrounding the longer ratchet sound units are\nshortened (1.34 ^ 0.14 s prior to the onset of the ratchet and 1.53 ^ 0.17 s from the offset\nof the ratchet to the onset of the next ‘r’) while the silent durations surrounding the short\n‘y’ sound units are lengthened (1.73 ^ 0.17 s prior to the onset of the initial ‘y’,\n2.03 ^ 0.13 s between the two ‘y’s and 2.02 ^ 0.11 s from the offset to the onset of the\nnext ‘r’). One-way ANOVAs indicated significant differences between the onset silent\ndurations (ANOVA: F1,17 ¼ 30.0, P , 0. 001) and offset silent durations (ANOVA:\nF1,17 ¼ 55.6, P , 0.001).\nThe typical phrases from 2001 shown in Figure 3 consist of a louder grunt sound\nfollowed by a run of identical sounds and ending with two soft low pitch sounds. In nearly\nevery case, the initial phrases consisted of runs of the same ‘r’ sound units described\nabove. In nearly 75% of the cases, the r-phrases simply switched to y-phrases. The number\n12 S. Handel et al.\nDownloaded by [Stephen Handel] at 15:29 01 April 2012 \nof sounds within the r- and the y-phrases was dramatically different, Mean ^ SD:\n6.18 ^ 0.94 and 13.9 ^ 5.17 respectively (ANOVA: F 2,118 ¼ 95.4, P , 0.0001).\nNonetheless, there was no difference in the overall durations of the two phrases\n(23.84 ^ 2.29 s and 24.33 ^ 2.41 s respectively).\nDiscussion\nHierarchical and sequential expectation\nThe uncertainty distributions and conditional source entropies are remarkably similar\nacross the seven-year span of the songs despite large qualitative differences in the themes,\nphrases, and sound units themselves, and in the sequences of those song elements.\nKnowledge of any component of the song, theme, phrase, or previous sound unit, reduces\nthe source entropy of another component dramatically. Somewhat surprisingly,\nknowledge of the theme, phrase, and previous sound unit reduce the source entropy to\nthe same degree, and further information about the sound unit sequence reduces the source\nentropy to the same degree given the theme and phrase. Overall, knowledge of the phrase\nreduces the source entropy more than the theme as would be expected, by creating better\nresolution of the song structure.\nAll of the above analyses were conceptualized in terms of a ‘top-down’ hierarchy.\nThemes contain phrases, and phrases contain sound units. But, in reality, the themes and\nphrases are organizations imposed by human coders using heuristics based on Gestalt\nprinciples, i.e. a general rule to keep runs of identical sounds intact. Whales have only the\nsound sequence and from that may create groupings that do not necessarily match or be\nless orderly than those imposed by human researchers. With this caution in mind, the\nconditional source entropy of themes and phrases given the sound unit is 1.04 ^ 0.34 bits\nand 1.42 ^ 0.43 bits respectively, and the source entropy of themes given the phrase is\n0.26 ^ 0.35 bits. Thus, given a sound unit, the source entropy of the theme and phrase in\nwhich it is embedded is dramatically reduced and given the phrase the source entropy of\nthe theme in which it is embedded is reduced to practically zero. Hearing a sound unit\n‘tells’ the whale more than what is the most probable next sound; it tells the whale where it\nis in the song, and that tells the whale what are the most probable next phrase and theme.\nEven though the songs are quite different in the nature of their themes, phrases, and\nsound units, they are equally and similarly constrained. We propose that it is this constraint\nthat underlies the ability of humpbacks to predict the next sound unit and to detect changes in\na song that may occur over a mating season. We believe it is this syntax, as well as the\nrecurrent bigrams detected by Green et al. (2011) that maintain the ‘plasticity’ of the song\ndescribed by Garland et al. (2011) and Noad et al. (2000). The recurrent bigrams can be\nthought of as a ‘local’ production constraint determining the allowable sound unit\nsequences. Green et al. (2011) offer several plausible explanations for these restrictions\nsuch as genetic predispositions or physiological limitations, but it appears difficult to\ndetermine a set of rules that will predict those bigrams. The syntax can be thought of a more\n‘global’ constraint determining the theme and phrase structures based to some degree on the\nlocal production constraints. The consistency of these constraints suggests that there are\ncognitive limitations to the whale’s ability to produce ever more complex evolving songs.\nWhale songs, bird songs, and human songs\nAn exhaustive comparison of whale, bird, and human songs is beyond the scope of this\npaper. All three are organized hierarchically (Todt and Hultsch 1998 for bird song;\nBioacoustics 13\nDownloaded by [Stephen Handel] at 15:29 01 April 2012 \nLerdahl and Jackendoff 1983 for human song). Individual sound units are grouped into\nphrases or syllables, and the phrases are grouped into themes or song types. Yet there are\nstriking differences among the three at all levels of the hierarchy. At the individual sound\nlevel, for humpback songs, there seem to be an almost limitless number of sound units;\nthey are constantly being invented as can be seen in Figures 1–4. For bird songs, there are\nwide species differences; some birds have a limited set of species-specific sounds that do\nnot vary, while others consistently incorporate sounds from other bird and non-bird\nspecies (Kelly et al. 2008). For human songs, there seem to be a limited set of discrete\npitched sounds although each song culture may use a slightly different set of frequencies.\nAt the phrase level, for humpback and bird songs, adjacent phrases share sound units, but\ndistant ones do not, and while there may be motor constraints the sequence of the sounds\nwithin each phrase can vary widely. In contrast, for human songs the same notes occur in\nall phrases and there are usually only small pitch steps between adjacent notes. The small\npitch steps probably ensure that the melody remains coherent (Bregman 1990). At the\ntheme level, for humpback and bird songs, the hierarchical connections between phrases\nare merely one of adjacency. The hierarchy is flat; there is no rationale for connecting pairs\nor triplets of phrases beyond that of shared notes. Perhaps it would be better to think\nof songs being based on intersecting Venn-like themes rather than being hierarchical.\nIn contrast, the hierarchy for human songs can relate notes widely separated in time based\non tonality; the sequence of notes builds expectations that are culturally specific and are\nresolved in time (Lerdahl and Jackendoff 1983, Huron 2006). The order of the sounds\nchanges the meaning, while this does not seem to be true for humpback or bird songs\nbecause those songs are probably just advertisements for sexual selection (Smith et al.\n2008). Thus, the hierarchical representation of human songs can have several levels while\nthose for humpback and bird songs usually have but two. Finally there is the issue of\nlearning. Humpbacks appear to learn the revamped song throughout the mating season\n(Eriksen et al. 2005). Fledgling birds begin with a set of babbled sounds that progress to a\ncontinuous ‘subsong’ containing varied sounds. That song then coalesces into shorter\nstereotyped phrases separated by silences that may never change (Byers and Kroodsma\n2009). There is still a great deal of controversy about the development of the tonal\nhierarchy in human song (see Patel 2008, for a review). Probably the development is based\non general auditory processes.\nHere we briefly concentrate on the distribution of the sound elements within whale and\nhuman phrases. Given the phrase, the source entropies of the whale sound units are\ndramatically reduced, equalling that given the previous sound unit. Different sound units\nare found in each phrase. This is not true for human songs; the identical notes are found in\neach phrase so that the source entropy given the phrase is far greater than given the\nprevious note. Based on a small sample of six songs found in The Great Family Songbook\n(Fox and Weissman 2007) ranging from the ‘Star-Spangled Banner’ to ‘Greensleeves’, we\ncalculated the H (S), H[P] [S], and H [S (t þ 1jt)] uncertainties. Means ^ SDs in bits were\n3.86 ^ 0.39, 2.67 ^ 0.35, and 1.36 ^ 0.20 respectively and are found in Table 1. Thus,\nthe uncertainty of the sound units H (S) and the source entropy H [S (t þ 1jt)] for the whale\nand human songs are nearly identical, but the conditional source entropy H[P] [S] is more\nthan double. The same notes are found in each phrase (and theme) so that knowing the\nphrase does not reduce the source entropy of the note.\nThus, humpback songs differ from human songs. By constructing songs in which each\nphrase consists of a set of unique sound units, whales reduce their memory load. Given the\nphrase (or theme), the next sound unit comes from a small subset of all the possible sound\nunits. We do not know what triggers a change in the current song. Whether the change was\n14 S. Handel et al.\nDownloaded by [Stephen Handel] at 15:29 01 April 2012 \ninduced by a random event, through error, through perhaps an interaction between two or\nmore males, or as an elaboration to attract a female, the singing whale would have to\nremember the change and where it occurred. Listening whales would need to compare the\nrevised song to the current song to detect and copy any differences. Both processes are\nmore likely to succeed if every sound unit is found in different parts of the song.\nConclusions\nIn humpback whale song, the local and global constraints resulting from the sound unit\nsequence appear to combine with the constraints of the rhythmic organization to restrict\nthe range of possible songs. Without these constraints, we believe it would be very difficult\nfor an individual whale to detect and incorporate changes in the complex song made up of\nsound units of differing timbres throughout a mating season. Any such change would still\nconform to these constraints. We suggest that it is these constraints along with rather slow\nproduction of the sounds that minimize any limitations in the whale’s ability to make use\nof the statistical properties of the sound unit sequence to derive each version of the song as\nit evolves. Successful performance of the song must depend on memory, and the highly\nstructured sequences may have increased the adaptive value of the song by reducing the\nmemory load required to remember the sequence.\nAcknowledgements\nWe would like to thank Dr Edward Parsons for his statistical help. We would also like to thank Mr\nPaul Knapp for supplying the whale song from the Virgin Islands.\nNotes\n1. Many authors include an intermediate level termed subphrases. For example the phrase (aabb) would\nbe considered to be composed of two subphrases aa and bb. We will not consider that level here.\n2. For source entropies conditioned on different hierarchical levels, we use subscripts to indicate the\nconditioning level.\nReferences\nBregman A. 1990.

INTRODUCTION\nRoughly 40 years ago Payne and McVay1 described predictable patterns of sounds produced by humpback whales as\n“songs.” They developed descriptors to analyze humpback\nwhale songs in terms of tree-like levels progressively linking\nadjacent sound units: Song sessions consist of repeated\nsongs, which consist of repeated cycles of themes, which\nconsist of repeated phrases, which consist of repeated patterns of individual sounds (called units). Payne and Payne2\nlater reported that singers from all locales almost always\nconformed to these “rules of song form,” and suggested that\nsongs were hierarchically structured because of syntax-like\nconstraints on song production. This descriptive framework\nhas since been widely used leading many researchers to suggest that the complex structure of humpback whale songs is\none of its most universal and intriguing features.\nIn what sense could humpback whale songs be hierarchical? All hierarchies contain elements in one level that are\nembedded in higher levels. The higher levels create the contextual interpretation of the elements. For example, in sentences, certain words become subjects, verbs, and objects\nwithin one hierarchy although the same words would have\nanother interpretation in a different hierarchy. Consequently,\nsentences such as “they are flying planes,” can be interpreted\nin multiple ways. Similarly, certain musical tones become\nthe musical center (i.e., the tonic) in one hierarchy, but are\nmerely ornamental notes in another. The usefulness of such\nhierarchical descriptions rests on their ability to capture the\nprocesses that producers and listeners use when constructing\nand interpreting a sound sequence.3\nWe do not believe that characterizing whale songs as hierarchical meets this condition. Whale researchers describe\nhumpback whale songs as hierarchical because the regular patterns within songs are generally consistent with the hierarchical\nframework proposed by Payne and McVay.1 However, the fact\nthat hierarchical descriptors can be useful for analyzing variations in humpback whale songs provides no evidence that the\nsound sequences being analyzed are hierarchical in either production or perception. Watches provide a simple way of hierarchically classifying time but this does not provide evidence\nthat time itself is hierarchically structured. More generally, evidence of higher order structure in sound sequences does not\nprovide evidence of hierarchical organization.4 Consequently,\nthe recent information theoretic analyses of songs by Suzuki\nand colleagues5 also provide no evidence that songs are hierarchical. In the case of birdsong, bioacousticians generally\nfocus less on theoretical definitions and instead use behavioral,\nphysiological, or acoustic data to support claims that birdsong\nis hierarchical.6 None of these approaches can be applied to\nsinging whales, leaving acoustic analyses as the only viable\napproach to clarifying how whale songs are structured.\nII. ANALYZING STRUCTURE IN WHALE SONGS\nUnlike most songbirds, humpback whales do not use a\nfixed repertoire of sounds, phrases, themes, or songs, but\ninstead gradually modify the sounds and sound patterns that\na)Author to whom correspondence should be addressed.

As a result, a necessary first step in traditional analyses of song structure is to\nidentify the regularities within a recording and then to label\nrepeated patterns as songs, themes, or phrases.7\nAnalyses of songs in terms of such groupings can\nincrease our understanding of the singing behavior of humpback whales independently of whether the songs are hierarchically structured. Regardless, descriptions of song\nstructure solely in terms of unit sequences suffer from two\ncritical shortcomings. First, the partitioning of sequences is\ninherently ambiguous. For example, Fig. 1 shows the types of\nperiodic acoustic regularities that initially led researchers to\ndescribe humpback whale vocalizations as songs. Unlike the\nsongs of humans and most songbirds, humpback whale songs\nhave no clear beginning. Instead, a position in the sequence\nmust be arbitrarily chosen as the start of the “first” theme\n(designated numerically). How dissimilar two pattern sequences must be to qualify as different themes is subjectively\ndetermined. Consequently, the number of theme designations\nfor identical recordings may vary across investigators.8\nJust as hierarchical descriptors partition song sessions\ninto discrete songs and songs into discrete themes, they also\ndivide themes into sets of discrete phrases. Again, there are\nno clear acoustical features that identify where one phrase\nends and another begins; what counts as a phrase for songs\nfrom a given year is typically decided based on subjective criteria that may vary across investigators. Figure 2 shows examples of sound patterns typical of those that would traditionally\nbe classified as phrases. The patterns contain several acoustic\nregularities, including repetitions of similar units and similar\npatterns of timing across units. The hierarchical framework\nprovides little guidance as to whether these patterns should be\nclassified as instances of a single phrase type or of two different phrase types. Furthermore, without additional information\nit is impossible to determine whether Fig. 2 shows two different phrases containing six and eight units, respectively, or\nfour phrases containing three or four units.\nSecond, because the hierarchical approach to partitioning songs emphasizes uniformity within themes, dissimilarities across themes, the prevalence of particular themes, and\nthe order in which themes are produced, it obscures acoustic\nfeatures that may be important to understanding the structure\nand function of songs. Returning to Fig. 2, regardless of how\nthese patterns are classified, they show several acoustic regularities that traditional analyses are likely to miss, including\nthe consistency of pattern timing despite changes in the number of constituent units and the consistency of spectral shifts\ndespite large differences in the forms of individual units.\nFurthermore, as Fig. 1(b) illustrates, such properties can\nbe highly stereotyped across song repetitions. In this particular example, spectral energy peaks near two frequencies (90\nand 180 Hz) alternate throughout the recording. The timing\nof spectral shifts in these bands is nearly identical for two of\nthe three cycles shown; the remaining cycle appears to contain a time-compressed version of this same spectrotemporal\npattern. Such stereotypy suggests that the acoustic properties\nof at least a subset of sounds within this sequence are being\ngradually modulated across the entire song cycle. The regularly spaced vertical striations in this spectrogram further\nindicate that some units were produced at a consistent pace\nfor over an hour. Analyses that focus on identifying structure\nin sequences of symbolically notated units5 are incapable of\nFIG. 1. Spectrogram of singing by a\nhumpback whale.

MODELING NON-HIERARCHICAL STRUCTURE\nIN SONGS\nThe hierarchical framework is a descriptive model of a\nhumpback whale song. This model names salient elements of\nsongs and provides an interpretation of resulting song structure. However, when subjectively salient features are chosen\nto be consistent with a pre-existing theoretical framework, it\nbecomes difficult to distinguish structure in the sequences\nfrom structure imposed by the methods. The hypothesis that\nhumpback whale songs are hierarchically structured has never\nbeen empirically tested, and it is not clear how it could be.\nMoreover, this hypothesis does not explain any of the regularities present within songs, it does not make any novel predictions about how songs should vary within or across\nindividuals, years, or geographic locations, nor does it explain\nhow whales detect and incorporate changes in their evolving\nsongs. Below, we describe an alternative, non-hierarchical\nmodel of humpback whale song structure that is explanatory\nrather than descriptive and that makes testable predictions.\nThe model assumes that basic physical constraints on\nsound production lead to acoustic regularities within songs\nby restricting when certain sounds or sound patterns can be\nproduced. Specifically, two interacting physiological cycles\nare hypothesized to contribute to the sequential structure\nobserved within humpback whale songs: The dive cycle and\ninternal recirculation of air during sound production. In this\nframework, the apparent hierarchical structure within humpback whale songs is a consequence of production constraints\nrather than syntactic rules.\nSinging humpback whales often spend long periods\n(10 to 20 min) submerged,11 intermittently rising to the\nsurface briefly to breathe before diving again. As illustrated in\nFig. 1, singers do not stop singing when they surface. Nevertheless, it is sometimes possible to acoustically detect when a\nsinger is surfacing because sounds produced near the surface\ntend to be quieter due to greater propagation loss. Furthermore, in some seasons certain acoustic features within songs\nconsistently occur when a singer is surfacing.2,12 The diving\ncycle associated with breathing can potentially impact song\nstructure in at least three ways. First, changes in the depth of\nthe singer can lead to changes in the volume and pressure of\ninternal air cavities, which can in turn affect sound generation.13 Second, as the time a singer spends underwater\nincreases, respiratory processes will lead to changes in the\nproportions of internal gases, which can affect the resonance\nfrequencies of air cavities. Finally, sounds or sound patterns\nmay vary in terms of their energetic demands, such that the\nnumber of times each sound pattern is produced may partly\ndetermine how long a singer can remain submerged.\nSingers make sounds while submerged without producing\nany bubbles that would indicate air is leaving their bodies.\nThis suggests that humpback whales recirculate air internally\nas they sing. Singers can potentially produce “egressive”\nsounds as air flows from the lungs, and “ingressive” sounds as\nair flows into the lungs. Bidirectional sound production could\nconstrain the structural features of songs in two ways. First,\nthe acoustic qualities of egressive sounds usually differ systematically from those of ingressive sounds.14 Consequently,\nbidirectional phonation automatically leads to the cyclical\nproduction of contrasting sound types. Production of certain\nsounds may only be possible during specific phases of the\nrecirculatory cycle. Second, because airflow in one direction\nprecludes airflow in the other, vocal processes associated with\nairflow in each direction will be interdependent and coordinated, potentially constraining the duration, form, and rhythmic timing of sound patterns.\nTogether these two cycles of diving and recirculatory\nsound production can account for several regularities within\nsongs. For example, the recurring shifts in overall song frequency content shown in Fig. 1 may reflect dive-cycle dependent changes in sound production. Specifically, as the\nratio of carbon dioxide to oxygen gradually increases within a\nsubmerged singer, the frequencies with peak energy should\ndrop. This is because sound velocity in oxygen is higher than\nin carbon dioxide; as oxygen is depleted, sound velocity will\ndecrease, which will in turn lower the resonant frequencies of\ngas-filled cavities involved in sound production.15 Also, when\na singer surfaces the change in depth and the influx of oxygen\nshould lead to a rapid shift in spectral energy. Both of these\nfeatures are evident in Fig. 1(b). Stereotypical ordering of\nthemes may thus partially reflect acoustic regularities caused\nby the diving cycles of singers. Deviations from typical theme\nsequences are associated with surfacing,12 as would be\nexpected if dive cycles directly impact the ordering of sound\npatterns within songs.\nFigure 2 illustrates how recirculatory sound production\ncould lead to repeating patterns within dive cycles. The\n“RRR(atchet)” pattern can be interpreted as two egressive\nsounds followed by an ingressive sound (or vice versa).\n“RRWW” corresponds to the same pattern but with a faster\ninspiration rate; faster air flow causes slow-repetition-rate\npulse trains to transform into tonal sounds by increasing the\nvibratory rate of sound producing membranes to the point\nwhere pulse interval and pulse duration are comparable.15\nRhythmic repetition of this three or four sound pattern may\nthus reflect the periodic shunting of air to and from the lungs.\nThe relatively stable timing across such repeating patterns,\ndespite changes in the number and types of units within the\npatterns, is indicative of physical constraints related to cyclical features of air recirculation. In Fig. 2, the admittedly speculative description of particular sounds as being egressive or\ningressive reflects the fact that ingressive sounds often are\nmore variable and contain spectral energy at higher frequencies.14 Identifying how humpback whales produce different\nsounds can clarify how internal air recirculation may contribute to both unit and song structure.\nThese two physiological cycles are interactive because\nchanges in internal and external conditions throughout a dive\ncycle can potentially impact a singer’s ability to effectively\ncontrol sound production within recirculatory cycles, and the\ndifficulty of producing different acoustic features may\nJ.

Processes in which two or more physiological cycles interact to\ndynamically generate structured patterns can be described as\nheterarchical.16 In heterarchical processes, there is neither a\nfixed order of precedence that determines sequential structure nor a simple set of rules that predicts how structure\nwithin a sequence will change over time.\nOne advantage of the heterarchical model of song structure described above is that it can be empirically tested. For\ninstance, the model predicts that rhythmic patterns within\nsound sequences can be directly related to movements of air\nwithin a singer’s body, and that the qualities of sounds\nwithin patterns will be correlated with the direction of internal airflow. Because gases within the lungs are the most\nacoustically reflective features of a submerged whale, the internal movements of air within a singer can potentially be\nmonitored either remotely, using high-frequency sonar, or\ncutaneously using ultrasound. The model also predicts that\nsequential structure should be evident not only in the qualities of sounds but also in the rhythms of sound production17\nand in transitions across sounds.9 Furthermore, the model\npredicts that the sequence of acoustic features within songs\nwill be correlated with a singer’s depth and surfacing patterns,12 a prediction that can be tested using data from either\ntags or critter cams.\nAnother advantage of this non-hierarchical model is that\nit explains several properties of song structure that hierarchical descriptions have not. First, information theoretic analyses\nhave identified two periodic cycles within song sessions: One\nspanning 6 to 8 units; the other spanning 200 to 400 units.5\nThe heterarchical model identifies these periodicities as a consequence of the recirculatory cycle and dive cycle, respectively. Second, humpback songs are dynamic along multiple\ntime scales, evolving within individual sessions and across\nyears. The heterarchical model explains the capacity of singers to simultaneously preserve and yet continuously transform\nthese sequences by identifying physiological constraints on\nsound production. In particular, this model suggests that certain patterns can only be produced at certain times within a\ndive cycle or recirculatory cycle, and that the modifiability of\na sound or pattern depends both on how it is produced and\nwhen. In the heterarchical model, shifts in song structure only\nrequire minor adjustments to vocal gestures, and changes in\nsong structure across years reflect the same processes that\nlead to changes across hours. Third, singers often produce\nsound patterns in highly regular orders.2 In the heterarchical\nmodel, song consistency reflects physiological factors rather\nthan syntactic rules of sequence construction. For example,\nthe consistency of sequences over time is predicted to reflect\nthe consistency of singer depth and surfacing intervals.\nFinally, as illustrated in Fig. 1, the heterarchical model\nexplains the periodic, gradual modulation of sound frequency\ncontent over time as resulting from physiological processes\nassociated with diving and long duration submersion.\nFuture computational analyses of acoustic regularities\nwithin humpback whale sound sequences, as well as experimental studies of how these features correlate with singer’s\nmovements, may provide new insights not only into how\nhumpback whale vocalizations are structured, but also into\nhow different sound production mechanisms contribute to\ntheir structure. We are not merely proposing that the heterarchical model described above supplements the traditional\nhierarchical framework by suggesting mechanisms to\nexplain the sequencing of units within songs. Instead, we are\nproposing that the heterarchical model should supersede the\nhierarchical framework as the working model for understanding humpback whale song structure. This alternative\nperspective suggests several new questions that researchers\ncould explore, including: Are some patterns within songs\neasier for singers to modify than others? Might a singer surface or change depth to modulate the sequence of sound patterns being produced? To what extent are the rhythmic\nfeatures of songs a consequence of physiological versus\nfunctional constraints? Is it possible that the temporal dynamics of songs could reveal the swimming patterns and behavioral strategies of singers? Answering such questions can\npotentially move us closer to discovering how humpback\nwhales make use of the acoustic structure within songs.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe thank Brittany McIntosh and Jessica McCordic for\ntheir comments on an earlier version of this paper.\n1\nR.

A recent hypothesis suggests\nthat the number of different call combinations in monkeys\nincreases with increased number of predator species.\nHowever, the existence of combinatorial rules in great ape\nalarm calls remains largely unstudied, despite its obvious\nrelevance to ideas about the evolution of human speech. In\nthis paper, we examine the potential use of combinatorial\nrules in the alarm calls of the only Asian great ape: the\norangutan. Alarm calls in orangutans are composed of syllables (with either one or two distinct elements), which in\nturn are organized into sequences. Tigers and clouded leopards are predators for Sumatran orangutans, but in Borneo,\ntigers are extinct. Thus, orangutans make a suitable great\nape model to assess alarm call composition in relation to the\nsize of the predator guild. We exposed orangutans on both\nislands to a tiger and control model. Response compositionality was analyzed at two levels (i.e., syllable and syllable\nsequences) between models and populations. Results were\ncorroborated using information theory algorithms. We made\nspecific, directed predictions for the variation expected if\norangutans used combinatorial rules. None of these predictions were met, indicating that monkey alarm call combinatorial rules do not have direct homologues in orangutans. If\nthese results are replicated in other great apes, this indicates\nthat predation did not drive selection towards ever more\ncombinatorial rules in the human lineage.\nCommunicated by J.B.

Alarm calls . Predation .\nPrimates . Orangutans\nIntroduction\nSeveral nonprimate mammal and nonhuman primate species\nuse sophisticated combinatorial capacities in their call systems to influence conspecifics and/or predators (Blumstein\n1999; Zuberbühler 2002; Clarke et al. 2006; Arnold and\nZuberbühler 2008; Ouattara et al. 2009a, b; Schel et al.\n2010; Candiotti et al. 2012; Kershenbaum et al. 2012; ten\nCate and Okanoya 2012). Animals can generate, generalize,\nand categorize call strings or sequences; learn about the cooccurrence of elements within call sequences; and learn\ncombinatorial rules such as attending to phonetic similarity\nbetween elements, co-occurrence of elements, and duplication of elements, although the animal capacity for learning\nabstract rules needs substantial more independent research\n(ten Cate and Okanoya 2012). Within the primate clade,\nsuch combinatorial rules have been mainly described in\nmonkeys and lesser apes. Similar primate rules are only\nknown to exist in humans. This is relevant to the debate\non the emergence of recursion (the capacity to generate an\ninfinite range of expressions from a finite set of elements),\nwhich is suggested to represent a uniquely human component of language (Hauser et al. 2002). Remarkably, however,\nthe call systems of great apes have seldom been studied for\nthe potential occurrence of call combinations (cf. Crockford\nand Boesch 2005; Clay and Zuberbühler 2011). In nonprimate mammals and nonhuman primates, such evidence\nhas mostly been demonstrated in alarm call systems\n(Zuberbühler 2002; Clarke et al. 2006; Arnold and\nZuberbühler 2008; Ouattara et al. 2009a, b; Schel et al.\n2010; Candiotti et al. 2012; Kershenbaum et al. 2012). A\nrelevant question is, thus, whether predation constituted an\nimportant ecological effect for the emergence and evolution\nof combinatorial rules in the primate lineage. Such possibility would be in agreement with several observations indicating that nonhuman primates exert some flexibility over\ntheir antipredator (acoustic) responses, such as variation of\nalarm calls according to predator guild (Kavanagh 1980;\nFichtel and Van Schaik 2006; Fichtel and Kappeler 2011)\nand adjustment of antipredator responses to newly introduced predators or local predator guild (Gil-da-Costa et al.\n2003; Rainey et al. 2004; Yorzinski and Ziegler 2007; Schel\nand Zuberbühler 2009).\nA recent study has presented evidence supporting the\nhypothesis that increased predation pressure (i.e., number\nof predator species) increases the number of ways monkeys\ncombine alarm call elements, that is compositionality\n(Stephan and Zuberbühler 2008). This hypothesis suggests\nan ecological/evolutionary scenario with predation operating\nas selective pressure towards more call combinatorial rules\nin our early ancestors and conceivably towards the emergence of acoustic recursion in the hominin lineage. The\npredation pressure hypothesis (Stephan and Zuberbühler\n2008) implies that predator species with different physiognomic/behavioral features elicit different call responses by\nprimate prey; thus, a larger number of predator species will\nelicit a larger number of different call responses by the\nprimate prey. There are potentially two ways to communicate about new predators. The first is to invent or learn novel\ncall types. This, however, requires fine voluntary motor\ncontrol over call production, which is limited in nonhuman\nprimates (Cheney and Seyfarth 2005; cf. Owren et al. 2010).\nThe second possibility is thus to assemble the same call\ntypes differently into novel sequences generating a larger\nnumber of different call responses using combinatorial rules\n(e.g., Zuberbühler 2002; Candiotti et al. 2012). Although it\nis highly likely that hominins experienced some periods of\nincreased predation pressure (e.g., big cats, canids) in the\ncourse of evolution (Hart and Sussman 2008), for instance,\nduring range expansions or migrations, the generality of the\npredation pressure hypothesis for increased compositionality in human evolutionary lineage has not yet been assessed\nin great apes.\nOrangutans offer a useful great ape model to examine\nthese two major questions on (1) the possibility of combinatorial rules in great ape alarm calls and (2) the possibility\nof predation effects on the compositionality of great ape\nalarm calls. On both islands where orangutans occur,\nSumatra and Borneo, alarm calls towards potential predators\ncomprise four different single calls—kiss squeak (KSQ),\ngrumph (GR), gorkum (GK), and complex call (CXC)—\nand three combined calls—KSQ + GR, KSQ + GK, and\nKSQ + CXC (Hardus et al. 2009a), thus producing seven\npossible syllables. Each of these seven syllables has been\nwell described and is distinguishable audibly and/or by\nvisual inspection of spectrograms (Hardus et al. 2009a)\n(see aim.uzh.ch/orangutannetwork). Orangutan alarm call\nresponses towards potential predators typically last several\nminutes and can continue for more than an hour, creating\nsequences of syllables with varying length and with silence\ngaps between sequences of varying length. Therefore, the\norangutan alarm call system allows the analysis of compositionality at two levels: single and combined calls within\nsyllables and syllables within sequences. Other antipredator\nbehavioral responses by orangutans include shaking branches\nand throwing branches at the predator (Hardus et al. 2009b),\nbut here, focus is only given to alarm calls.\nThe predators preying on orangutans differ between\nSumatra and Borneo. While clouded leopards (Neofelis diardi)\nand pythons (Python spp.) constitute potential arboreal predators on both Borneo and Sumatra (Rijksen 1978), tigers\n(Panthera tigris sumatrae), which are largely terrestrial but\n520 Behav Ecol Sociobiol (2013) 67:519–528\nAuthor's personal copy\nprey upon orangutans (Rijksen 1978), are only present in\nSumatra. In Borneo, the presence of tigers has been suggested\nat two locations for the Late Pleistocene and Early Holocene\n(circa 10–12 ka (Piper et al. 2007) or 400–480 orangutan\ngenerations ago (Wich et al. 2009b)), but there is no evidence\nthat their distribution extended beyond these regions and tigers\nhave become extinct since then. Although the exact timing of\nthis extinction is not known, there are no historical records of\ntigers in Borneo after this period. Hence, the geographic\ndistribution of orangutan natural predators allows investigating the predation pressure hypothesis on the alarm calls of\ngreat apes. In the absence of a predator, a reduction of the\nnumber of different combinations is expected in Borneo, as\nthe predator’s specific call sequence would become obsolete and there would be no advantages for learning this\nsequence by individuals in the population. In monkeys, this\nprocess is observed over a period of 30 years (Stephan and\nZuberbühler 2008); thus, one would expect, at least, similar\neffects in orangutans.\nIn this study, we exposed female orangutans to a predator\nmodel (i.e., tiger model) and to a control model (i.e., white\nmodel of the same shape) at two sites, one on each island,\nKetambe (Sumatra) and Tuanan (Borneo). Only at Ketambe\nare orangutans familiar with tigers. We first assessed the\npossibility of combinatorial rules and the effect of predation\nat the syllable level (i.e., single and combined calls). When\norangutans use combinatorial rules at the syllable level, we\nexpect syllable frequencies to vary between models at\nKetambe (because one model is familiar and the other\nunfamiliar), but not at Tuanan (because both models are\nunfamiliar). When predator presence affects orangutan use\nof syllables, we expect that syllable frequencies will differ\nbetween populations when presented with the tiger model\n(because the model is familiar in one population but\nunfamiliar in the other), but not when presented with\nthe white model (because the model is unfamiliar in\nboth populations).\nSecondly, we assessed the possibility of combinatorial\nrules and effects of predation at the level of syllable sequences. When orangutans use combinatorial rules at the level of\nsyllable sequences, we expect that the rate of performing (at\nleast) two- and three-syllable sequences will differ between\npredator and control model at Ketambe, but not at Tuanan.\nWhen predation affects orangutan syllable sequences, we\nexpect that the rate of (at least) two- and three-syllable\nsequences will differ between Ketambe and Tuanan towards\nthe tiger model, but not towards the white model. If orangutans use syllable sequences with a larger number of syllables, this will be detectable in the use of two- and threesyllable sequences. Moreover, at each level of compositionality (syllables and syllable sequences), we condense our\ndata and replicate the analyses by categorizing syllable and\nsyllable sequences as (composed by) single or combined\ncalls, irrespective of the exact type of call(s). For instance,\nfor KSQ, KSQ + GR, and KSQ + GK, we consider instead\none single call and two combined calls, respectively. In\naddition, we analyzed the data using information theory\nalgorithms (Kershenbaum et al. 2012) to validate the results\nobtained.\nMethods\nSite and data collection\nData were collected at Tuanan (2°09′ S, 114°26′ E), Central\nKalimantan, Borneo, and Indonesia, between December\n2004 and August 2005 and at Ketambe (3°41′ N, 97°39′ E),\nAceh, Sumatra, and Indonesia, between December 2010 and\nMay 2011, following the same protocol. Six females were\ntested at Ketambe and five females at Tuanan. These individuals constituted the most habituated adult females resident in the central part of each study site. Orangutans live in\ndispersed fission–fusion communities, where females spend\nthe majority of their time alone with the exception of their\nown single offspring (Delgado and van Schaik 2000). Other\nfemales could not be experimentally tested due to extremely\nlow encounter rates by human observers. All females tested\nwere parous with dependent offspring, except one female\n(i.e., nulliparous) at each population. The predator model\nconsisted of a realistic tiger-patterned sheet draped over a\nhuman demonstrator who is walking on fours (Fig. 1). A\nsimilar model, but covered with a white sheet, exposed to\nthe same orangutan females, served as an experimental\ncontrol, in order to isolate the effect of familiarity with\ntigers. When a focal female was between 12- and 20-m\nheight in the forest, feeding, resting, or slowly moving, the\nmodel moved past in front of the focal. The model halted for\napproximately 2 min when the focal viewed it and then\ncontinued moving until out of sight. Model movements\nrelative to the subject orangutan were coordinated by an\nFig. 1 Tiger model in experimental setting\nBehav Ecol Sociobiol (2013) 67:519–528 521\nAuthor's personal copy\nadditional human observer collecting behavioral and acoustic data continuously from the appearance of the model until\n30 min after disappearance. Experiments were never conducted in the same location in the forest. Each individual\nwas exposed only once to each model, and the two different\nmodels were presented to the same individual at least 5 days\napart to avoid habituation. Presentation order of the models\nwithin population was pseudo-randomized according to the\nfemales whose location was known.\nThe use of a clouded leopard model as control in both\npopulations was not conducted for several reasons. First, the\npresentation of the clouded leopard model on the ground (to\npreserve experimental settings consistent across models)\ncould be perceived by orangutans as an encounter presenting\nlittle underlying danger, as clouded leopards characteristically\nhunt through the canopy. Second, the presentation of the\nmodel on the canopy would require a different presentation\nscheme since it would be impossible for a human demonstrator to walk on fours through the canopy. Third, because\norangutans are fundamentally arboreal, the presentation of a\nmodel on the canopy, instead of on the ground, could be\nperceived differently by orangutans. For instance, a wild\norangutan highly habituated to humans and followed for more\nthan three decades may respond intensively when encountering human in the canopy (ARL and MEH, personal observation). Fourth, responses towards a model in the canopy could\ninvoke responses due to proximity to the model, creating\nbiases between models.\nData analyses\nFor syllable analyses, single- and combined-call syllable\nrates were considered during the first 10 min of the\nalarm call response towards either model, since in an\nencounter with a potential predator, this will be the most\ncritical period in prey response. That is, during this\nperiod, we measured the number of occurrences of each\nof the seven syllables comprising orangutan alarm call\nrepertoire (see above).\nFor syllable sequence analyses, firstly we identified the\noptimum duration of silence that would indicate a break\nbetween syllable sequences. This was necessary because\nsilence gaps between orangutan syllables have varying durations, and the choice of intersequence gap affects the number and length of sequences. For instance, a 5-s silence gap\nbetween potential syllables sequences yields a smaller number of sequences than a 30-s silence gaps for the same data\nset. We calculated the duration of silence gaps at which the\nincrease of the number of sequences with respect to gap\nduration decelerated (i.e., when the increase rate became\nless than 1). We considered this to be the optimum point\nbecause of the trade-off between simplicity/speed and versatile/informative communication in alarm calls (cf. Kemp\nand Regier 2012). For this calculation, we used the first\n10 min of alarm call response towards the tiger model by\nall six females at Ketambe, as these responses were expected\nto be the most syllable dense from all predator model experiments. We determined the number of two- and three-syllable\nsequences when considering 5-, 10-, 15-, 20-, 25-, and 30-s\ngaps between syllable sequences for these responses. We\nfitted a logarithmic curve through the average number of\nsyllable sequences, averaged across the six females. The\nnonnegative numerator of the second derivative of this\nlogarithmic curve indicates the length of the silence gaps\nabove which the increase rate of the number of sequences\nbecomes less than 1. This value is equal to the coefficient of\nln(x) in the fitted logarithmic curve (Lyons 1995).\nSecondly, we identified all two- and three-syllable\nsequences emitted by all females in both populations towards both models. When orangutans use syllable sequence\nrules, one expects that these will be frequently used and\nconventionalized between the individuals of the population.\nAccordingly, only those two- and three-syllable sequences\nthat were used by at least two individuals of one population\nat one type experiment and that were produced at least five\ntimes by one of the two individuals were considered for\nstatistical testing. A syllable comprised by a combined call\n(e.g., KSQ + GR) differed unequivocally from a syllable\nsequence composed by the same calls (e.g., KSQ − GR), in\nthat calls follow each other immediately within a combinedcall syllable (i.e., less than 500 ms) while they are separated\nby more than 3 or 4 s within a sequence.\nFinally, to examine the presence of combinatorial rules\nby means of an alternative method, we used a technique\ntaken from information theory to examine the data content\nof the different call sequences. We generated Markov transition tables separately for each individual, indicating the\ntransition probabilities between common sequences, where\neach element Ta,b of the transition matrix represents the\nprobability that sequence a will be followed by sequence\nb. We then calculated the entropy of the transition table\nH ¼  1\nN2\nP\na\nP\nb\nTa;b ln Ta;b\n , where N is the number of\ndistinct sequences. Transition table entropy is a measure\nof the deviation from random sequences (Cover and\nThomas 2006) and hence an indication of the extent\nto which combinatorial rules are being used. Entropy\nmeasures have been used to analyze animal acoustic\ncommunication sequences in various taxa, including hyraxes (Kershenbaum et al. 2012) and humpback whales\n(Suzuki et al. 2006). We used two-way ANOVA to test\nfor differences in Markov entropy between populations\nand between models, using as our null hypothesis that\nneither population location (Sumatra vs. Borneo) nor\nmodel type (tiger vs. white) affects the combinatorial\ncomplexity of call sequences.\n522 Behav Ecol Sociobiol (2013) 67:519–528\nAuthor's personal copy\nApparatus\nAll calls were recorded during the experiments with a\nMarantz Recorder PMD-660 with a Rode NTG2\nMicrophone (at Ketambe), with a Marantz Recorder\nPMD222 with a Sennheiser Microphone ME 64, and with\na Sony Recorder TCD-D100 with a Sony Microphone\nECM-M907 (at Tuanan). Statistical tests were conducted\nusing IBM SPSS 19 (2010, SPSS, Inc.), with significance\nlevel set at P<0.05.\nResults\nSyllable analyses\nTotal emission rate of syllables did not differ between populations for both models (Mann–Whitney U: tiger model—\nNKetambe=6, NTuanan=5, exact P=0.20; white model—\nNKetambe=6, NTuanan=5, exact P=0.18). Median syllable\nrates (25 and 75 % percentiles) were 6.2 min−1 (2.7,\n7.225) and 8.4 min−1 (5.75, 12.1) at Ketambe and Tuanan,\nrespectively, towards the tiger model, and 0 min−1 (0, 3.1)\nand 4.3 min−1 (0.2, 8.35) towards the white model.\nThe emission rate of only one syllable (KSQ) was higher\ntowards the tiger model than the white model at both sites\nKetambe and Tuanan (A in Table 1 and Table S1). None of\nthe syllable rates differed between populations for each\nmodel (B in Table 1 and Table S1). When condensing the\ndata, and considering syllables solely either as single- or\ncombined-call syllables (S or C), the emission rate of singlecall syllables differed between models only at Tuanan, with\nhigher emission rates towards the tiger (A in Table 1).\nMoreover, the emission rate of single-call syllables towards\nthe tiger model was higher at Tuanan than at Ketambe (B in\nTable 1). To verify whether these results were solely an\neffect of high KSQ emission rates, we conducted the analyses once again but excluding KSQs. Emission rates of\nsingle calls differed no longer between models at Tuanan\n(Mann–Whitney test, N=5, Z=−0.904, P=0.366) or\nbetween populations towards the tiger model (Mann–\nWhitney test, NKetambe=6, NTuanan=5, Z=−1.354, P=0.176).\nSyllable sequence analyses\nThe number of two- and three-syllable sequences per\nminute increased when a longer duration of silence gaps\nbetween syllable sequences was permitted (Fig. 2). The\naverage number of sequences plotted against the duration\nof silence gaps fitted a logarithmic curve (R2\n=0.957, y=\n17.514×ln(x)+0.307; Fig. 2). Accordingly, the logarithmic coefficient 17.514 indicates the optimum duration of\nsilence gaps (see “Methods”). Since we assessed the number of syllables sequences at 5-s intervals, we considered\nthe value of 15 s for the duration of silence gaps between\nsyllables for subsequent analyses.\nFrom a total of 49 (i.e., 72\n) possible two-syllable sequences, 33 different sequences were recorded at Ketambe towards the tiger model and 11 towards the white model,\nwhereas 11 and 15 different sequences were recorded at\nTuanan. The two populations did not differ in the total\nemission rate of two-syllable sequences to either of the\nmodels (Mann–Whitney U: tiger model—NKetambe=6,\nNTuanan=5, exact P=0.2; white model—NKetambe=6,\nNTuanan=5, exact P=0.135). Median two-syllable sequence\nrates (25 and 75 % percentiles) were 5.5 min−1 (1.725, 6.3)\nand 7.4 min−1 (4.65, 11.35) at Ketambe and Tuanan, respectively, towards the tiger model, and 0 min−1 (0, 2.725) and\n3.0 min−1 (0.1, 7.5) towards the white model.\nWe determined whether the use of particular two-syllable\nsequences seemed habitual. Overall, eight two-syllable\nsequences were used by at least two individuals in a single\npopulation in response to the same model and were used at\nleast five times by at least one of these individuals (Table\nS2). Within populations, the rate at which these two-syllable\nrates were given to the two models did not differ significantly (A in Table 2). However, two (out of eight) sequences\ngiven towards the tiger model (i.e., KSQ − KSQ and KSQ +\nGR − GR) were given at significantly higher rates,\nconcerning one sequence at each population (B in Table 2).\nTable 1 Exact P values of statistical comparison per syllable (A) between models within populations and (B) between populations for each models\nKSQ GR GK CXC KSQ + GR KSQ + GK KSQ + CXC S C\nA Ketambe 0.041(T) 0.655 0.715 0.109 0.102 0.144 0.066 0.225 0.141\nTuanan 0.043(T) 1 0.655 0.317 0.461 0.345 1 0.043(T) 0.223\nB Tiger 0.056 0.361 1 1 0.203 0.134 0.104 0.022(Tu) 0.853\nWhite 0.056 0.361 1 1 0.203 0.134 0.104 0.251 0.91\nSignificance of italicized values at p<0.05.

However, the\nrate of one two-syllable sequence (i.e., single call–single\ncall) towards the tiger model was higher at Tuanan than at\nKetambe (B in Table 3).\nBased on the same silence criterion, we also distinguished three-syllable sequences. From a total of 343 (i.e.,\n73\n) possible three-syllable sequences, 63 and 20 different\nsequences were recorded at Ketambe towards the tiger and\nthe white model, respectively, and 23 and 27 different\nsequences were recorded at Tuanan, respectively. The rate\nof three-syllable sequences did not differ between populations for both models (Mann–Whitney U: tiger model—\nNKetambe=6, NTuanan=5, exact P=0.17; white model—\nNKetambe=6, NTuanan=5, exact P=0.135). Median threesyllable sequence rates (25 and 75 % percentiles) were\n5.35 min−1 (1.5, 6.225) and 7.3 min−1 (4.9, 11.1) at Ketambe\nand Tuanan, respectively, towards the tiger model, and 0 min−1\n(0, 0.27) and 2.6 min−1 (0.05, 7.35) towards the white model.\nOverall, six three-syllable sequences were used by at\nleast two individuals in a single population in response to\nthe same model and were used at least five times by the\nsame individual (Table S3). One three-syllable sequence rate\ndiffered between models (i.e., KSQ − KSQ − KSQ) at\nTuanan, with higher rates emitted towards the tiger model\n(A in Table 4). Two sequences (out of six) differed between\npopulations (i.e., KSQ − KSQ − KSQ and KSQ + GR −\nKSQ − KSQ) towards the tiger model, with higher rates\nemitted at Tuanan (B in Table 4).\nWhen condensing our data pertaining to three-syllable\nsequences, one of the possible eight (i.e., 23\n) three-syllable\nsequences differed between models (i.e., single call–single\ncall–single call) at Tuanan, with higher rates emitted towards the tiger model (A in Table 5). The same threesyllable sequence towards the tiger model also differed\nbetween populations, with higher rates at Tuanan (B in\nTable 5).\nInformation theory analysis\nMarkov entropy (and hence combinatorial complexity) was\nslightly higher at Ketambe (N=7, mean 1.34±0.19 standard\nerror (SE)) than Tuanan (N=9, mean 1.11±0.11 SE).

In contrast, at Tuanan, the entropy was\nlower on presentation of the tiger model than the white\nmodel (N=5, mean 1.00±0.33 SE vs. N=4, mean 1.25±\n0.28 SE). However, the results of a two-way ANOVA test\nshowed no significant effect for population (P=0.601),\nmodel (P=0.590), or population–model interaction (P=\n0.115). Sample sizes differed between information theory\nanalysis and previous analysis because only individuals who\nproduced alarm calls could be included in the information\ntheory analyses.\nDiscussion\nThe results of this study show few differences between\norangutan alarm call responses towards different models\nand between different populations. Foremost, the only difference between models at both populations concerned the\nemission rate of KSQs, where individuals of both populations emitted significantly more KSQs per unit of time\ntowards the tiger model than the white model (Table 2).\nThis suggests that both populations perceived a tigerpatterned sheet as being potentially more dangerous than a\nwhite sheet. This indicates that, as predicted by the multipredator hypothesis (Blumstein 2006), pattern recognition at\nTuanan, where tigers are absent, may have persisted after\npotentially up to 480 generations due to the presence of\nother cat predators with a patterned fur, such as the clouded\nleopard. Nonetheless, it seems unlikely that orangutans in\nboth populations could have mistakenly identified the tiger\nmodel as a clouded leopard (which is present in both populations), since the size and hunting techniques differ between the two cats and their fur pattern is distinct; in\nSumatran tiger’s fur, the black outline is comprised by\nnarrow and vertical stripes on a largely orange background\nwith pronounced white parts, while in Sunda clouded leopard’s fur, the black outline is comprised by round forms,\nwith both dense black and spotted sections and with thin\norange gaps between black forms, without any pronounced\nwhite parts.\nAt Tuanan, a significantly higher emission rate of single\ncalls was detected towards the tiger model than the white\nmodel (Table 2). However, this was verified to be an effect\nof the high emission rates of single KSQs. The fact that\nindividuals at Tuanan emitted significantly higher rates of\nsingle-call syllables towards the tiger model than individuals\nat Ketambe seems also to be due to the high emission rates\nof single KSQs. At the level of syllable sequences, some\ntwo- and three-syllable sequences differed between models\nat Tuanan and between populations towards the tiger model.\nHowever, all these sequences included KSQs as one or two\nsyllable(s). Hence, these results may therefore be an effect\nof considerably high emission rates of single KSQs. For\ninstance, emission rates of KSQ + GR − GR towards the\ntiger model were significantly higher at Ketambe than\nTuanan, but this sequence was not used significantly\nmore at Ketambe towards the tiger model than the white\nmodel; thus, this population difference was unlikely\nmeaningful.\nAltogether we did not find evidence to support our predictions related to either the use of combinatorial rules or an\neffect due to predation guild size on combinatorial rules of\norangutan alarm calls. We expected that different syllable or\nsyllable types (i.e., S and C) would be used to indicate\ndifferent models in the population experiencing tiger predation (i.e., Ketambe) while predicting these differences on\nTable 3 Exact P values of statistical comparison of two-syllable\nsequences (A) between models within populations and (B) between\npopulations for each models, considering single- and combined-call\nsyllables irrespective of call type(s)\nSS SC CC CS\nA Ketambe 0.345 0.465 0.109 0.465\nTuanan 0.08 0.336 0.279 0.5\nB Tiger 0.044(Tu) 0.926 0.926 1\nWhite 0.205 0.29 0.09 0.134\nS single call, C combined call, A Wilcoxon signed-rank test, B Mann–\nWhitney test\nTable 4 Exact P values of statistical comparison of three-syllable sequences between models within populations and between populations for each\nmodel\nKSQ + GR − KSQ +\nGR − KSQ + GR\nKSQ − KSQ − KSQ KSQ − KSQ +\nGR − KSQ + GR\nKSQ + GR −\nKSQ − KSQ\nKSQ + GR −\nKSQ − KSQ + GR\nKSQ + GR −\nKSQ + GR − KSQ\nA Ketambe 0.068 0.180 0.655 0.317 1 1\nTuanan 0.273 0.043(T) 0.414 0.705 0.465 0.593\nB Tiger 0.664 0.015(Tu) 0.421 0.037(Tu) 0.246 0.146\nWhite 0.562 0.091 0.351 0.351 0.294 0.139\nA Wilcoxon signed-rank test, B Mann–Whitney test\nBehav Ecol Sociobiol (2013) 67:519–528 525\nAuthor's personal copy\nsyllable use to be absent in the population lacking this\npredator (i.e., Tuanan). However, this was not found.\nSyllables were not used differently by individuals of the\ntwo populations nor used differently against the two\nmodels. In addition, the analysis of two- or three-syllable\nsequences also did not uncover any patterns. Moreover,\nthe information theory analysis did not reveal any difference in entropy. Therefore, we do not have evidence for\nthe use of combinatorial rules in orangutans to signify\npredators.\nThe lack of significant effects may be due to the relatively\nlow statistical power of analyses with small number of\nfemales comprising local populations. However, we sampled all possible females at each population, and extending\nthe number of individuals would lead to heterogeneous\nsamples. However, the few obtained significant results were\nopposite to the predictions built at the start of the study.\nMoreover, information theory analyses corroborated the\nresults. Thus, conclusions can be drawn with relative\nconfidence.\nInterestingly, orangutans within populations showed considerable variability in their alarm call responses. These\ndifferences suggest that orangutan alarm call system may\nnot be strictly hardwired and affect-based (sensu Owren and\nRendall 2001), as commonly assumed. Indeed, orangutans\nare suggested to socially acquire some aspects of their alarm\ncall system related to the production of KSQs (e.g., use of\ninstrumental tools during KSQ production, van Schaik et al.\n2003, 2009; Hardus et al. 2009b). This may also be the case\nwith other types of alarm calls. Moreover, these considerable differences within populations exclude the possibility\nthat habitat differences (e.g., canopy height above 12–20 m\navailable for escape) affected our results in any crucial\nmanner. These intrapopulational differences, in combination\nwith relatively low numbers of individuals in the sample,\nlimited our ability to interpret in detail the obtained results\nand to detect biologically meaningful differences in orangutan alarm calls towards different predators, specially so at\nthe site where tigers were familiar. In addition to significant\ndifferences in the use of KSQs, other components of orangutan’s antipredator behavioral responses showed differences\nbetween the tiger and the white model. For instance, mean\nand maximum number of branches thrown at the models\nwas 1 magnitude order higher towards the tiger than the\nwhite model (ARL, MEH, and SAW, unpublished data).\nWhile these latter data are preliminary and lay outside the\ndirect scope of this article, they confirm to some extent that\norangutans perceived the models differently and suggest\nthat, as it occurs in monkey species (Kavanagh 1980;\nFichtel and Van Schaik 2006; Fichtel and Kappeler 2011),\nalarm call usage may be flexible and dependent on multiple\nfactors.\nThe results suggest that the combinatorial rules known to\norganize monkey alarm calls (Zuberbühler 2002; Arnold\nand Zuberbühler 2008; Ouattara et al. 2009a, b; Schel et\nal. 2010) do not apply in a straightforward way to orangutan\nalarm calls. Moreover, the absence of an island difference in\norangutans’ response suggests no effect of the size of predator guild on alarm call complexity in this genus, suggesting\nthat the selective pressure due to predation on behavioral\nand alarm call responses is much stronger in monkeys than\nin orangutans. This may be a result of the relative larger\nbody size of orangutans compared to monkeys, which\nreduces the number of predator species as, for instance,\nraptors do not prey on orangutans and an healthy adult\nmay only be successfully hunted by the largest cat species.\nIf this negative proportional rule between prey body size\nand predators’ number is accurate, one may then expect\nsmaller nonhuman primates (and perhaps smaller nonprimate mammals as well) to present a richer repertoire in\nterms of combinations’ number relatively to bigger species\n(of the same taxon) when their alarm call system is\nbased on call combinations. This may be addressed by\nfuture research.\nFuture work should also investigate whether the effect of\npredator guild applies to other great apes, which are on\naverage more terrestrial. If it is confirmed, this suggests that\npredation may have remained a relatively relaxed selective\npressure for ground-dwelling hominins, facilitated by the\nacquisition of effective material culture (e.g., van Schaik et\nal. 2003) and subsequent fire control (e.g., Wrangham and\nBooks 2010), even though they must have encountered new\nTable 5 Exact P values of statistical comparison of three-syllable sequences (A) between models within populations and (B) between populations\nfor each model, considering single- and combined-call syllables irrespective of call type(s)\nSSS SSC SCS SCC CCC CCS CSC CSS\nA Ketambe 0.345 0.715 0.593 0.715 0.068 0.715 1 0.715\nTuanan 0.043(T) 1 0.273 0.465 0.273 0.715 0.498 1\nB Tiger 0.017(Tu) 0.925 0.773 0.711 0.644 0.711 0.562 0.848\nWhite 0.205 0.484 0.562 0.562 0.416 0.134 0.29 0.662\nS single call, C combined call, A Wilcoxon signed-rank test, B Mann–Whitney test\nLetters in parentheses indicate model or population with significantly higher syllable emission rate\n526 Behav Ecol Sociobiol (2013) 67:519–528\nAuthor's personal copy\npredator species both before and after migrations out of the\nregion of origin, including new species of felids, canids, and\nursids (Hart and Sussman 2008).\nOverall, our results are consistent with the view that,\nwithin the primate clade, the emergence and use of combinatorial rules may be dependent on the number of critical\nevents in the environment about which the individuals communicate, modulated by the species’ ability to learn new\ncalls. Thus, combinatorial rules are positively selected when\nthe number of the species’ single alarm calls is lower than\nthe number of predators. This is the case in some monkey\nspecies, as mentioned above. On the other hand, because\ngreat apes may be able of extending their alarm call repertoire with new calls (Hopkins et al. 2007; Hardus et al.\n2009b; Wich et al. 2009a, 2012) and because they are\npreyed upon by fewer species, the threshold for the emergence and use of combinatorial rules is not reached. In other\nmonkey species other than Diana monkeys (Cercopithecus\ndiana), such as vervets (Chlorocebus pygerythrus), selective\npressures seem to operate differently, where each predator\nspecies is assigned a distinct single alarm call (Cheney and\nSeyfarth 1992), instead of a combined call or call sequence.\nFurther studies are needed to examine the conditions that\nfavor the evolution of such a system rather than the combined call-based alarm system of Diana monkeys.\nMoreover, the work by Stephan and Zuberbühler (2008)\nshould be replicated with other monkey and nonprimate\nmammals species using combined calls to assess the general\nvalidity of the predation pressure hypothesis within such\ntype of alarm systems and the putative indirect role of body\nsize (as a determinant of predators’ number). Only such a\ncomparative database on the presence of combinatorial rules\nin multiple primate and nonprimate mammal species and the\nconditions favoring such rules will provide an evolutionary\nframework for understanding the evolution of speech combinatorial communication.\nAcknowledgments This study was financially supported by Fundação\npara a Ciência e Tecnologia (SFRH/BD/44437/2008), Wenner-Gren\nFoundation for Anthropological Research, Dr. J.L.
